Your doctor will advise you of the correct dose for your individual needs.  The instructions on the label should remind you what the doctor said.   You may only need to use your Turbohaler once a day in the evening but you must only do this if your doctor has specifically told you to.  It is most important that you take it at the same time each evening.   If you notice your asthma is getting worse particularly if you have only been taking Pulmicort Turbohaler once daily (eg you are using your blue relief inhaler more often or you hove more symptoms) you should double your dose of Pulmicort immediately and talk to your doctor as soon as possible.  If you need to do this and you have been taking Pulmicort Turbohaler once daily, double your dose by taking the same number of inhalations your doctor told you to but do it twice a day, once in the morning and again in the evening.  If you are already taking it twice daily double your dose by simply taking double the number of inhalations  each time.   If Pulmicort Turbohaler is to be used by your child you should make sure that it is used correctly, as your doctor has told you.

You frequently wake up at night with asthma.     You develop chest tightness in the morning or if it persists for longer than usual.           FORGOTTEN TO TAKE A DOSE ?   If you forget to take an occasional dose, don't worry, it is not necessary to compensate for the dose you have missed.   Just take the next dose as usual.     IF YOU HAVE TAKEN TOO MUCH   If you take too much Pulmicort Turbohaler talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  Always use your inhaler as your doctor has told you.     HOW TO USE YOUR TURBOHALER   Turbohaler is very easy to use.  Simply follow the instructions given below.      Unscrew the white cover and pull it off.     Hold your Turbohaler upright with the brown base at the bottom as shown.  Turn the brown base in one direction as for as it will go.  Then twist the brown base back again as far as it will go.  You should hear a 'click'.  Your Pulmicort Turbohaler is now loaded.  Only load the inhaler when you need to use it.  Every time you load the inhaler the indicator window will show one less actuation.     Breathe out gently but DO NOT breathe out through the inhaler.  THEN place the   inhaler between your lips and BREATHE IN through your mouth as deeply and as hard as you con.     Remove the inhaler from your mouth and hold your breathe for about 10 seconds or for as long as is comfortable, then breathe out slowly.     If you are to take a second inhalation repeat steps 2, 3 and 4.     Replace the cover after use.     You should brush your teeth and rinse your mouth out with water after using your Turbohaler.     The medicine may not leave a taste in your mouth.  You can still be confident that  the dose has been inhaled if you have followed the instructions.     CLEANING INSTRUCTIONS:   The outside of the mouthpiece should be cleaned regularly (weekly) with a dry  tissue.   The mouthpiece should   NEVER   be washed         HOW DO I KNOW WHEN MY INHALER IS EMPTY ?   When a red mark first appears in the indicator window as shown, there are about 20 actuations left.  You will need to see your doctor for another prescription.  When the red mark has filled the indicator window, your Turbohaler is empty.  The brown base will still twist and 'click' even when the inhaler is empty.    Note:   You may hear a sound when you shake your Turbohaler.  This is not caused by the medicine but by a drying agent.       AFTER TAKING YOUR MEDICINE   Side -effects that may occur when taking Pulmicort Turbohaler are:     Rash     Sore mouth (oral thrush).  This is less likely if you rinse your mouth out with water after taking Pulmicort Turbohaler.     Mild sore throat, coughing and a hoarse voice.     Like other steroids at high doses budesonide may have an effect on the adrenal gland.  Your doctor may ask for a blood sample from time to time.

Tell your doctor if you experience any of these or if you notice anything else unusual.     STORING YOUR MEDICINE   Keep your Pulmicort Turbohaler at room temperature (below 30°C).

LIVING WITH YOUR HEART   What you can do to help yourself     Your doctor will give you advice on the various ways you can help your heart and build up your general health.   FRUMIL FORTE is sometimes used for treating conditions that may affect the heart, although your doctor may have given you FRUMIL FORTE for some other reason.   If you would like to know more about why you have been given FRUMIL FORTE, check with your doctor.    Changing your diet   If you are overweight your heart has more to cope with. So it's a good idea to get as close to your ""ideal"" weight as possible. If you do not know what your ""ideal"" weight should be, check with your doctor, surgery nurse or pharmacist.   Whatever weight you are, it's also important to cut down the amount of fat you eat, preferably by up to a quarter. You can do this by:     eating less red meat and more chicken, fish and vegetables,     grilling rather than frying food,     buying skimmed or semi-skimmed milk rather than full-fat milk,     eating low fat cheese,     including more fibre in your diet by eating more cereals, potatoes, leafy vegetables and fruit.        Giving up smoking   Medical research has clearly shown that smoking is bad for the heart, so it's important that you stop smoking now. You'll not only feel better and breathe more easily, but you'll also be saving lots of money.     Stress - and how to avoid it   You can help your heart by learning to enjoy relaxation and avoid stressful situations. Obviously you can't avoid stress altogether but if you follow a regular routine that puts less pressure on you then you'll be all the better for it.     What about alcohol?   Moderate drinking, such as half a pint of beer or a glass or two of wine a day, but not every day, won't harm the heart. However, you should avoid drinking more than this as it may affect your heart and increase your weight into the bargain.     Finding the right exercise   Your doctor can advise you on a planned programme of activity. This will improve your general health without putting too much of a strain on your heart. At first, you should avoid walking up steep hills or staircases with lots of steps. Eventually, though, you can build up to a regular routine of walking, swimming or cycling, or a combination of these.     For further advice   If you would like more information or guidance it is worth approaching the following support group.

"      Demser (metirosine, MSD)   PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS LEAFLET CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU START TO TAKE YOUR MEDICINE.   Keep this leaflet. You may want to read it again.    What is in your capsules?    Active ingredient   The active ingredient in your capsules is metirosine. Demser is available as two-tone blue, opaque capsules containing 250 mg of metirosine USP.     Other ingredients   Hydroxypropyl cellulose EP colloidal anhydrous silica EP, indigo carmine E132 titanium dioxide E171, gelatin EP.   Demser Capsules are available in bottles of 100.      How do your capsules work?   The active ingredient in your capsules is metirosine. Metirosine inhibits an enzyme called tyrosine hydroxylase which is important in the production of certain hormones including adrenaline and noradrenaline. These hormones are naturally occurring chemicals in your body and are involved in the control of heart rate and blood pressure. In certain diseases, where adrenaline and noradrenaline are produced in abnormally high levels, treatment with metirosine is used to reduce these amounts.     Who makes your capsules?   Your capsules are made by Merck Manufacturing Division Merck & Co. Inc., West Point, Pennsylvania USA, for Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited, Hertford Road, Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, UK, who hold the Product Licence in the UK and the Product Authorisation in Ireland.     Why do you need to take these capsules?   Your doctor has prescribed Demser for you to treat a condition known as phaeochromocytoma, which .,e will probably have explained to you. Phaeochromocytoma is a tumour which usually occurs near the kidney, and secretes the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline. The increased levels of these hormones, if left untreated, may cause high blood pressure and increase your risk of stroke, heart attack and damage to your kidneys.     Are there patients who should not take these capsules?   Yes, do not take the capsules if you have had a bad reaction to this or similar medicines, or to any of the ingredients in the past.   Demser should not be given to children under 12 years of age.   Demser is not suitable for the treatment of ordinary high blood pressure or 'essential hypertension'.   If you think any of these apply to you, do not take the capsules, go and talk to your doctor first and follow his advice.     What else should you know before taking your capsules?   You should check with your doctor before taking the capsules if:     you have or have had liver or kidney disease.     you are or think you may be pregnant.     you are planning to become pregnant.     you are breast-feeding.     Your doctor will probably have told you that it is important that you drink plenty of liquids while being treated with Demser. Your doctor might examine your urine occasionally during treatment and suggest that you increase the amount of liquid you are drinking.     What about alcohol?   Alcohol should be avoided during treatment with 'Demser', as the medicine may increase the effects of alcohol.      What about driving and operating machinery?   When you start taking the capsules, or if the dose is increased, Demser may make you feel weak and drowsy and reduce physical coordination. If this occurs, you should avoid hazardous activities like driving, or operating machinery.   If you are unsure or confused, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.     Can you take Demser with other medicines?   There are a few other medicines which may not mix with 'Demser'. Your doctor knows about these and will alter your treatment as needed. It is important that you tell your doctor about all the medicines you are taking, including any drugs obtained without a doctor's prescription.   If you are taking any of the following medicines, you should talk to your doctor about them: sleeping pills, sedatives, tranquillisers and anti-anxiety agents.     How should you take Demser?   You must take your capsules by mouth exactly as advised by your doctor or pharmacist. The number of capsules you take each day will depend on your condition. For many people the initial dose is 1 capsule four times a day, which may be increased by 1 or 2 capsules daily. The dosage range is usually 8-12 capsules a day. When 'Demser' is given before an operation, the optimum dose range should be given for five to seven days before surgery.   Your doctor will probably monitor your condition regularly by carrying out laboratory tests on urine and, possibly, blood samples.     What if you forget to take a capsule or take too many?   If you miss a dose just carry on with the next one as normal. Do not take an extra one to make up.   If you take too many capsules by mistake, seek medical attention immediately.     What unwanted effects could your capsules have?   Like all medicines, Demser may occasionally cause side effects in some patients. The most common side effect is sedation or fatigue, which usually appears .within the first 24 hours of treatment, peaks after two or three days, and decreases during the next few Jays. Less frequent side effects are diarrhoea, drooling, trembling, jerky movements, and speech difficulty.   Anxiety, depression, hallucinations, disorientation and confusion may occur but usually disappear if the dose is reduced. Rarely, slight swelling of the breast, nasal stuffiness, dry mouth, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and impotence or failure of ejaculation, and occasional difficulty or pain in passing urine may occur. Slight swelling of hands or feet, and skin rashes, have occurred rarely.   Patients may have altered sleep patterns or increased alertness after stopping treatment.   If you notice any of the above effects, or you have any unusual symptoms or feelings, stop taking the capsules and seek medical attention.   You should remember to tell the doctor you are taking Demser if you have a blood, urine or other test, as the medicine may affect test results.     How should your capsules be kept?   Keep your medicine out of the reach of children.   Keep the container tightly closed, store below 25ºC, protected from light.

Hytrin BPH tablets come in 4 strengths and colours containing either 1 mg (white), 2 mg (yellow), 5 mg (tan) or 10 mg (blue) terazosin hydrochloride.    Your doctor will give you the tablets which are best for you.

PACK SIZES   Hytrin BPH is available in 4 packs:   The starter pack containing seven 1 mg tablets and seven 2 mg tablets (2 weeks treatment).   The 2 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg tablet packs each contain 28 tablets (4 weeks treatment).   Hytrin BPH belongs to a group of drugs called alpha blockers.  Its use is described below.   The Product Licence holder and manufacturer of Hytrin BPH is Abbott Laboratories Limited, Queenborough, Kent, ME11 5EL.     WHAT IS HYTRIN BPH FOR?   Hytrin BPH may be used for the treatment of a condition called benign prostate hyperplasia which is common in older men. This condition is caused by the prostate gland growing too big and obstructing the f low of urine from the bladder.  This leads to some unpleasant symptoms such as weak or interrupted urine flow, a need to pass water more frequently and/or a sudden need to pass water.   Hytrin BPH can relax the muscle of the prostate gland and bladder exit to help relieve these symptoms.     BEFORE TAKING HYTRIN BPH   If you are allergic to drugs called alpha-blockers, you should not take Hytrin BPH.  Speak to your doctor if you are not sure.   Before taking Hytrin BPH tell your doctor:   - If you are being treated for high blood pressure or if you are taking drugs to lower your blood pressure for any other reasons. This is particularly important if you are taking drugs called ACE inhibitors or diuretics.    -If you have ever fallen over or fainted while passing water.001-579~201      WHEN TAKING HYTRIN BPH     TAKE NOTE   When taking Hytrin BPH avoid missing doses.    AVOID DRIVING OR USING MACHINERY FOR 12 HOURS AFTER YOUR FIRST TABLET OF A STARTER PACK   because dizziness, lightheadedness or drowsiness can occur with the first dose or after missing doses and re-starting treatment.   You may also feel dizzy, lightheaded and may even faint if you stand up quickly after lying down. If this happens, lie down again, then sit for a few minutes before standing. Tell your doctor if this happens regularly.     TAKING HYTRIN BPH   Your doctor will ask you to take one Hytrin BPH tablet each day before bedtime.   You will at first be given a starter pack.  Inside the pack is a strip of tablets.  It is important that you   only take one tablet each day in the order shown on the strip.  This is so that you take the weakest tablets for the first 7 days and then a higher dose for the next 7 days.   When you have finished your starter pack, your doctor will give you a prescription for more tablets.  Depending on your response to Hytrin BPH, your doctor will decide which strength of tablet you need.   You should continue to take your tablets (one-a-day) unless your doctor tells you not to.   If you accidentally take an overdose (more than one tablet in one day) call your doctor immediately.    If you have not taken a tablet for several days you should NOT continue using the same tablets.   Return to your doctor for a new starter pack.     SIDE EFFECTS   Hytrin BPH sometimes causes side-effects such as headaches, dizziness, weakness, feeling  sick, a fast or uneven heartbeat, swelling, weight gain, sleepiness, difficult breathing, blocked nose, inflamed nasal passages, blurred vision, decreased sex-drive or impotence.  These symptoms are usually mild.  However, if you are worried about them, see your doctor.   If you are taking other drugs to lower your blood pressure you are more likely to have dizzy spells.   If you have any other unexpected or unusual symptoms, tell your doctor.     STORING YOUR MEDICINE   The use by (exp) date for your medicine is printed on one of the flaps of the carton and on the edge of the strip inside.  Always check this date.

"    PATIENT INFORMATION LEAFLET   PLEASE READ THIS LEAFLET CAREFULLY BEFORE USING    KOGENATE 500    What does KOGENATE contain?   KOGENATE is a freeze-dried powder which contains 500 International Units (IU) of Factor VIII (rDNA) (bhk).   It contains also human albumin, glycine, calcium chloride and 18 mg of sodium chloride. KOGENATE must be dissolved in the Water for Injections supplied before it is administered.   This box contains one 10 ml vial of freeze-dried KOGENATE powder.   You should have received another box connected to this box which contains:   One 10 ml vial containing 2.5 ml of Water for Injections.   Two sterile alcohol swabs for single use.      A blister pack containing:    One plastic syringe.   One venepuncture set.   One filter needle.   One transfer device.   The vial will appear to be only partially full but this is normal and does not mean that it contains the wrong amount of powder.   KOGENATE 500 contains Factor VlIl and is to be used to stop and/or prevent the bleeding you get with haemophilia A.   The Factor VlIl in KOGENATE is made by the process of genetic engineering as indicated by the initials (rDNA) (bhk) used above.     Product Licence/Authorisation Holder:   Manufacturer:     Bayer plc Bayer House Strawberry Hill Newbury Berkshire RG13 1JA Bayer AG Leverkusen Germany    Why have I been prescribed KOGENATE by my doctor?   KOGENATE has been prescribed by your doctor to stop and/or prevent the bleeding you might get with haemophilia A.   Haemophilia A is a disease which results because your body does not produce enough Factor VlIl.  Factor VlIl is a component in the blood which helps it to clot when you are bleeding.  If the level of Factor VlIl is low in your blood, your body will have difficulty in stopping bleeding.   You can use KOGENATE if you have never been treated for haemophilia before, or if you have previously been treated for haemophilia and have no antibodies to Factor VlIl (inhibitors) which would neutralise Factor VlIl in your blood.   If you have been using KOGENATE and you develop Factor VlIl inhibitors, treatment may be continued as long as you still respond to KOGENATE and the inhibitors in your blood remain below a certain level (10 Bethesda Units).  Speak to your doctor if you would like further information about this.   This product does not contain von Willebrand Factor, so it cannot be used in von Willebrand’s disease.     When should I not use KOGENATE 500?   Do not use KOGENATE if you are allergic to any of the ingredients.  If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor.   If you know that you are allergic to mouse or hamster protein, KOGENATE should not be used.  Consult your doctor if you are unsure about this.  Usually, if you are allergic to KOGENATE, a reaction will occur upon first use of the product.  Allergic reactions can occur at the injection site such as a burning sensation, temporary redness or a rash or you may experience nausea, dizziness or a tight chest.     What special precautions should I take?   If you think that you are having an allergic reaction to KOGENATE, stop administering the product immediately and seek medical advice.  Speak to your doctor regularly about your treatment.  He/she may wish to carry out tests to ensure that your current dose of KOGENATE is sufficient to reach and maintain adequate Factor VlIl levels.   If your bleeding is not being controlled with KOGENATE, consult your doctor immediately.  You may have developed Factor VlIl inhibitors and your doctor may wish to carry out tests to confirm this.  Factor VlIl inhibitors are antibodies in the blood which act against the Factor VlIl you are using.  This makes the Factor VlIl less effective in controlling bleeding.   If you are pregnant, planning a family or are breast-feeding, tell your doctor before using this product.  If you have informed your doctor already, follow his/her instructions carefully.   There is no evidence that Factor VlIl may impair your ability to drive or to use machines.     How much KOGENATE 500 should I use?   The amount of KOGENATE you use and how often you use it depends on many factors such as your weight, the severity of your haemophilia, the site and extent of bleeding, the amount of Factor VlIl inhibitors that you may have and the Factor VIII level required.   Your doctor will calculate the dose of KOGENATE and the frequency you should use it to get the necessary level of Factor VlIl activity in your blood.  He will do this according to   your   particular needs using the formulae below.   I)To determine the dose required for a given response:   Required IU = body weight (kg) x desired Factor VlIl rise (% of normal) x 0 5   II)To determine the response expected from a given dose:      Expected Factor VlIl rise (% of normal) = 2 x administered IU body weight (kg)   If you are infusing KOGENATE to stop a bleeding episode, the amount of KOGENATE you will need depends on the site and extent of your bleeding.  For example, if you are suffering a minor haemorrhage, such as bleeding into a joint, the plasma level of Factor VlIl activity should not fall below 30 % of normal for at least one day.  If your bleeding is more severe or you need an operation, the dose of KOGENATE and time of usage will increase.   If you are using KOGENATE to prevent bleeding (PROPHYLAXIS), your doctor will calculate the dose for you.  This will usually be in the range of 10 to 50 IU of KOGENATE per kg of body weight administered at intervals of 2 to 3 days.  However, in some cases, especially younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.   If you have a large number of Factor VlIl inhibitors, the dose of KOGENATE you are given by your doctor will be high to maintain the correct Factor VlIl activity in your blood.  If this dose does not control your bleeding your doctor may consider the use of an additional product (activated) prothrombin complex concentrate.  Speak to your doctor if you would like further information about this.    How do I administer KOGENATE 500?   If you have been prescribed KOGENATE to use at home, your doctor will have ensured that you know how to administer it.    If you are in any doubt about using KOGENATE, go back to your doctor for further advice and training before attempting to administer your treatment.    Follow the directions given by your doctor closely and use the instructions below as a guide:     Wash your hands thoroughly using soap and warm water.     Without opening either vial, warm the KOGENATE powder and the Water for Injections to room temperature.  This can be done by taking the vials from the fridge and allowing them to stand in a room for approximately one hour or, if needed to treat a bleed sooner, the vials can be warmed by holding them in your hands.             DO NOT leave the vials by a direct source of heat such as a radiator or fire in order to warm them quickly and try not to shake the vials KOGENATE must never be heated to more than 37ºC (body temperature)     Carefully remove the protective caps from both vials and clean each of the rubber stoppers with the sterile swabs supplied (diagram   A  )    IMPORTANT:   Use a fresh swab for each stopper.   An antiseptic spray may also be used and this can be purchased from your local pharmacist (chemist).     Stand the transfer device on a clean surface   making sure that the corrugated edge of the sleeve is facing upward.   (diagram   B  ).     Turn the vial containing Water for Injections upside down and mount it onto the transfer device (diagram   C  ).  Press them together firmly and then immediately place the combined Water for Injections vial and transfer device on top of the vial containing the KOGENATE powder.  Press into place firmly and then hold the three components in place until all the water has been drawn into the vial containing powder (diagram   D  ).     Remove the water vial and transfer device and dispose of them carefully Ask your doctor how.     Swirl the powder vial gently until all of the KOGENATE powder is dissolved and you have a clear solution (diagram   E  ).  Do not shake the vial vigorously.      Make sure that all of the powder has dissolved before going on to the next step    IMPORTANT Once the powder is dissolved in water, the solution must be used within four hours.         When all of the powder has dissolved, attach the filter needle to a syringe (diagram   F  ) and insert the needle after swabbing the stopper straight through the top of the vial into the dissolved KOGENATE by puncturing through the stopper.     Hold the vial upside down above the needle and syringe and draw out the plunger slowly and smoothly to fill the syringe (diagram   G  ).  Then, holding the plunger in place, remove the syringe from the filter needle.  (The filter needle should remain attached to the vial).     Attach a venepuncture set to the syringe (diagram   H  ).     Apply a tourniquet as previously demonstrated by your doctor or nurse.     Locate the point of injection and clean it with a sterile swab (not supplied).     Insert the solution into the tube of the venepuncture set by pressing the plunger of the syringe until the tube is approximately two-thirds full.     Puncture the vein and secure the venepuncture set in place with a plaster.  Make sure that no blood enters the syringe.     Remove the tourniquet.     Inject the solution slowly into the vein making sure that the needle remains in place.  The solution should be injected at a speed of 1-2 ml per minute.     If another vial of KOGENATE solution needs to be administered once the initial injection is complete, the syringe should be left connected to the venepuncture set.   Prepare a new vial as before (steps 1 to 9) and fill a new syringe. When you are ready to inject the solution, remove the old syringe from the venepuncture set and continue as before     If no further dose is required, remove the venepuncture set and syringe and hold a swab firmly over the injection site for about two minutes with the arm outstretched and held upward.  Finally, apply a small pressure dressing to the wound and discard any unused solution.     Dispose of the vials and venepuncture kit carefully, as directed by your doctor.  Do not dispose of them with your normal rubbish.    REMEMBER:If you have any doubt about administering KOGENATE correctly, consult your doctor for further advice.     DO NOT EXCEED THE PRESCRIBED DOSE.     If you inject more than the prescribed dose, or in the event of an overdose, seek medical advice and, if possible, take your KOGENATE and its packaging with you.      What should I do if I forget to use my KOGENATE?   Inject your normal dose as soon as you remember and then continue as prescribed by your doctor.     What side-effects may I experience?   A number of rarely reported side-effects have been observed with KOGENATE.  These include reactions at the injection site such as a burning sensation, temporary redness and rash.  Also, tightness of the chest, dizziness and nausea have been reported and mildly reduced blood pressure, which may make you feel faint upon standing.  If you experience any of these side-effects, consult your doctor for advice.   The formation of inhibitors (neutralising antibodies) to Factor VIII is a well-known, but rare complication in the management of haemophilia A.  This occurs mainly in patients who were previously untreated before receiving KOGENATE.  Therefore, you should inform your doctor if you were untreated prior to receiving KOGENATE, as he/she may wish to carefully monitor your progress.    IF YOU EXPERIENCE ANY OTHER UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS, TELL YOUR DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY.      How should I store my KOGENATE 500?   KOGENATE powder should be stored in a refrigerator (2 to 8ºC) until the expiry date which is shown on the packaging.   In exceptional cases, KOGENATE powder may be removed from the fridge and kept at room temperature (up to 25ºC) for a maximum period of three months as long as it is kept in the original packaging.  If you need to take your medicine from the fridge for a prolonged period of time, you must write the date of the end of the three month period on the space provided on the vial and/or the box immediately.

"    What you should know about Dobutrex   Please read this information carefully. It does not contain all the information about your medicine that you may need to know, so please ask your doctor or nurse if you have any questions. This leaflet only applies to Dobutrex.      What is in your medicine?   Your medicine is called Dobutrex. Its active ingredient is dobutamine hydrochloride. Your medicine came from a glass bottle supplied to the hospital containing 250mg of dobutamine hydrochloride dissolved in 20ml of sterile ‘Water for Injections’. Dobutrex also contains the inactive ingredient sodium metabisulphite.   Your nurse, doctor or pharmacist will have diluted the Dobutrex liquid before it went through a tube and needle from a bag or pump and into one of your veins. This is called a ‘continuous intravenous infusion’.   Dobutrex is an ‘inotrope’. An inotrope helps your heart pump blood more strongly every time it beats. Dobutrex is made by Lilly France SA, Zone Industrielle, Fegersheim, France. The product licence is held by Lilly Industries Limited, Dextra Court, Chapel Hill, Basingstoke, Hampshire, RG21 2SY.       Why Dobutrex?   Dobutrex is used to make your heart pump more strongly after some types of heart failure, open heart surgery or heart disease. It can also help your heart if you are on a 'PEEP ventilator'. It you are having a routine stress test, you may be given Dobutrex instead of exercise because Dobutrex makes the heart work harder.       Before your medicine is used    If you were too ill to discuss your treatment with your doctor, he or she will have decided whether it was safe to use Dobutrex.     Your doctor may ask you some questions if you are able to help.     If you answer YES to any of the following questions, tell your doctor or nurse. If you are not sure about anything, please tell them.      Have you ever had an allergic reaction to Dobutrex or 'sulphites'? (An allergic reaction may include rash, itching, swelling or difficulty in breathing.)     Are you pregnant or could you be?     Are you taking any other medicines such as beta blockers?      These are some of the things your doctor will have thought about:     Dobutrex is not normally used in children.     The dose must be enough to help your heart without making it beat too fast, increase your blood pressure too much or change the normal rhythm in your heartbeat (arrhythmia) Your doctor may change the dose to suit you as he or she measures these things Your doctor will be especially careful if your heart has 'flutter' or 'fibrillation' or if you have an 'acute myocardial infarction'     Inotropes such as Dobutrex may not help if your heart is blocked and cannot till or empty. Some patients' hearts have become hard and do not respond well to inotropes.     Dobutrex should not be used instead of exercise stress testing if you have 'unstable angina', a diseased heart valve, a blocked aorta or any other condition which would make exercise dangerous for you.     If your blood pressure drops the doctor may change your dose. He or she will be careful it you already have very low blood pressure.     The amount of fluid such as blood or plasma in your body must not be low when you are given Dobutrex. Your doctor may give you more blood or plasma before using Dobutrex   Please read the back of this leaflet    (Smaller than original)       What you should know about Dobutrex - continued           Taking your medicine     Your doctor will change the dose to suit your needs. Most people need from 2.5 to 10 micrograms of Dobutrex a minute for each kilogram of body weight. Some people may need larger or smaller doses than this.     Up to 20 micrograms of Dobutrex a minute for each kilogram of body weight is used for stress testing. The doctor will use an ECG machine to study your heart rhythms.     Dobutrex must only go into a vein     If you need Dobutrex for more than 3 days, your doctor may decide to step up the dose. When taking you off Dobutrex, he or she may lower the dose slowly.         While your medicine is used   Dobutrex may have some side-effects.     If it hurts where the needle went into your vein or along that vein, tell the nurse.     Tell the nurse right away if you get any of the following side-effects:     Nausea, headache, chest pain, palpitations or irregular heartbeat, difficulty in breathing or any allergic reactions.     Your doctor may check the potassium level in your blood because Dobutrex can affect it.     If you have any of the above or any other ill-effects, tell your doctor. He or she has more information about Dobutrex and will decide what to do.         How your medicine is stored     The hospital pharmacy should keep the 250mg bottles of Dobutrex below 25ºC. They should not use a bottle after the ‘Use before’ date.     When Dobutrex has been diluted the hospital should use it within 24 hours. The diluted Dobutrex can be kept at room temperature during this time. It may go slightly pink after it is diluted. This is normal.      REMEMBER: This medicine is for you.

Your treatment is one of a group of medicines called alpha-blockers. It Is usually used to treat high blood pressure. It may also be used to treat heart failure, painful cold fingers (Raynaud’s Disease) or mild enlargement of the prostate gland (prostatic hyperplasia) in men.     What is your     medicine for?   In patients taking Hypovase to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) the treatment works by relaxing blood vessels so that blood passes through them more easily.   In patients taking the tablets to treat heart failure the treatment works by relaxing the main blood vessels of the heart, allowing the heart to pump blood more easily.   The treatment is usually used in heart failure when other drugs are either inadequate. or have failed to work.    In patients with Raynaud’s Disease the treatment relaxes blood vessels in the hands, so blood can reach fingers more easily. This helps to prevent coldness and stiffness.   In patents with enlargement of the prostate gland the treatment is taken to treat poor and/or frequent passing of urine. This is common in patients with enlargement of the prostate gland. The treatment works by relaxing muscle around the bladder and prostate gland so urine is passed more easily.    If you are unsure why you have been prescribed Hypovase ask your doctor or pharmacist      Before you take your medicine     Have you had an allergic reaction to Hypovase in the past? This may have been itching reddening of the skin or difficulty in breathing.     Are you aged under 16 years of age?     Do you have heart failure because of another heart condition e g. heart valve disease or a recent heart attack)     If the answer to any of these questions is YES; tell your doctor immediately as this treatment may not be suitable for you.     If you have ever fainted after passing urine tell your doctor before you start the treatment     If you are pregnant or trying to become pregnant tell your doctor before you start the treatment.     If you are breast feeding tell your doctor before you start the treatment.     If you are taking other medicines tell your doctor before you start the treatment.     If you have liver or kidney disease tell your doctor before you start the treatment.       Things to take care about     Some patients are aware of feeling lightheaded or weak when starting to take Hypovase. This can happen when standing up and very occasionally this will cause a patient to hint. This very occasionally happens only when starting to take the tablets and does not usually happen again.     Most people do not feel light-headed You can help to prevent feeling lightheaded by rising slowly from a sitting or tying position.     If the treatment makes you feel light-headed or weak lie down until you feel better. Get up slowly when you feel better. If you are concerned tell your doctor.

IF YOU DID   NOT   TELL YOUR DOCTOR THEN YOU SHOULD DO SO   BEFORE   STARTING THE TREATMENT   Even so, your doctor may still want you to use the cream.    Face   YOU SHOULD NOT normally use on the face where the skin thins easily - BUT if your doctor has advised you to use it on the face then, if possible, the course of treatment should not last more than five days.

YOU SHOULD STOP   using the cream as soon as the skin problem is better. Sometimes only a few days treatment is needed. If there is no improvement after seven days, see your doctor again. Never use for more than four weeks without seeing your doctor again.     If your doctor has prescribed the cream for psoriasis you should let your doctor review your progress at regular intervals, as such treatment needs careful supervision.   This cream is for use on the skin only, but if accidentally swallowed small amounts are not harmful.  continued      Guidance on how much cream to use    If your doctor has told you in detail how to use the cream then keep to that advice otherwise:–   Twice a day, after washing your hands, gently rub the correct amount of cream into the skin until it has all disappeared.    For an adult:   You should find that two fingertips of cream will treat both hands or one foot three fingertips of cream will treat one arm six fingertips of cream will treat one leg fourteen fingertips of cream will treat the front and back of one trunk      Fingertip Units               Do not worry if you find you need a little more or a little less than this - it is only a rough guide.   Wash your hands before using the cream. Gently rub the correct amount into the skin until it has all disappeared.   Unless   used for treating the hands wash them again   after   using the cream. Anyone who helps to rub in the cream should also do the same or wear disposable plastic gloves.   The bacteria and fungi that cause infections like the warm, moist conditions under bandages or dressings so always clean the skin before a fresh dressing is put on.      For a child   It should not be used in children under one year of age.   The smaller the child the less you use.   A child of 4 years needs about a third of the adult amount.   A course of treatment for a child should not normally last more than five days unless your doctor has told you to use it for longer.      Has the cream any side effects?      Most people find using this cream causes no problems when used in the right amount for the correct length of time (See above).    IF   you find your condition gets worse during treatment you may be allergic to the cream or have a skin infection.       STOP USING THE CREAM AND TELL YOUR DOCTOR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE   Using more than the correct amount may:   -thin the skin so it damages easily -allow the active ingredient to pass through the skin and affect other pans of the body especially in infants and children, and during pregnancy.   Repeated courses of topical steroids over a long time may sometimes cause changes in hair growth and skin colour.   If you feel unwell or have any unusual discomfort you do not understand, tell your doctor as soon as possible.

"       WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT CANESTEN I PESSARY   PLEASE READ THIS LEAFLET CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU START YOUR TREATMENT IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR ARE NOT SURE ABOUT SOMETHING IN THIS LEAFLET, ASK YOUR DOCTOR OR PHARMACIST (CHEMIST)     WHAT IS VAGINAL THRUSH?   Thrush (vaginal candidiasis) is a common infection caused by a fungus which may live harmlessly in the vagina without you even noticing it.  However, in certain circumstances, it may develop into an infection in the vagina and the symptoms may spread to the surrounding area.   The common symptoms of thrush are:     itching of the vagina and surrounding area (the vulva)     redness and swelling of the tissues of the vagina and vulva     soreness of the vagina     a white non-smelling discharge from the vagina     Not everybody who has thrush will have all of these symptoms.  You may have only one of these.     If this is the first time you have had these symptoms, talk to your doctor before using any treatment.    If you have other symptoms such as:     irregular vaginal bleeding     abnormal vaginal bleeding or a blood-stained discharge     ulcers, blisters or sores of the vagina or vulva     lower abdominal pain     pain or difficulty in passing urine     fever or chills     feeling sick or vomiting     diarrhoea     a foul smelling discharge from the vagina   do not use Canesten 1 Pessary  .     It may not be the right treatment for you.    See your doctor as soon as possible.     If you are unsure that you have thrush, check with your doctor.    HOW CAN CANESTEN 1 PESSARY HELP YOU?   The name of your medicine is Canesten 1 Pessary.  This is one of a group of medicines called imidazoles which work by killing the fungus which has caused your symptoms.   WHAT IS CANESTEN 1 PESSARY?   It is an off-white vaginal pessary containing 500 mg of the active ingredient, clotrimazole.  The other ingredients are lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, lactic acid, maize starch, povidone, calcium lactate, magnesium stearate, silicon dioxide and poly (o-hydroxypropyl-o-methyl) cellulose.  A single-dose pack is a full course of treatment.    BEFORE USING CANESTEN 1 PESSARY   You should see your doctor before using Canesten 1 Pessary if:     you have had more than two infections in the last six months     you or your partner have ever had a sexually transmitted disease     you are pregnant or think you might be pregnant     you are aged under 16 or over 60 years     you have ever had an allergic reaction to Canesten or any other antifungal drug.      HOW TO USE CANESTEN 1 PESSARY   The carton contains a single Canesten 1 Pessary held inside a foil blister pack and an applicator for insertion of the pessary into the vagina.   Special care should be taken when using the applicator if you are pregnant.   Place the Canesten 1 Pessary in the applicator, which should be used to insert the pessary into the vagina at night before going to sleep.       Remove the applicator from the packaging.  Pull out plunger A until it stops.  Remove the pessary from the blister pack and place the pessary firmly into applicator B (Diagram 1).  To fit the pessary into the applicator, the holder of the applicator needs to be squeezed lightly at either side.  The pessary fits tightly into the applicator and needs to be squeezed into the holder just far enough to be held in place during insertion (about 1cm).      Carefully put the applicator as deeply as is comfortable into the vagina (this is easiest when lying on your back with your knees bent up) (Diagram 2).    Holding the applicator in place, slowly press the plunger until it stops so that the pessary is deposited into the vagina (Diagram 3).    Remove the applicator.  Dispose of the applicator in a safe place, out of the reach of children.   IN THE EVENT OF MISUSE OR ACCIDENTAL SWALLOWING Canesten 1 Pessary is for external   use   vagina  .  Don't put it in your mouth  or swallow it.  If you do accidentally swallow it, tell your doctor straight away or contact the Accident and Emergency Department of your nearest hospital.   THINGS TO LOOK OUT FOR AFTER USING CANESTEN 1 PESSARY The symptoms of thrush such as burning, soreness or itching of the vagina and surrounding area should disappear within three days of treatment.  If no improvement is seen after seven days tell your doctor   Canesten 1 Pessary may rarely cause side-effects in some people.  The side-effects are very similar to the symptoms of thrush.  If the redness, burning, irritation or swelling get worse, see your doctor as soon as possible.   If you feel you are reacting badly to this medicine in any other way, discuss this with your doctor or pharmacist (chemist).     HOW YOU CAN HELP PREVENT FURTHER INFECTIONS     Try to avoid wearing tights, nylon knickers and close fitting jeans too often.  These provide warm and airless conditions which help the thrush fungus to grow.       Wash daily, but use simple, bland soaps - not heavily scented or medicated ones.  Don’t scrub hard with sponges or flannels, and avoid hot baths with strong perfumed oils or disinfectants.  The most soothing bath to have, if you have thrush, is a warm one with some salt in it.     After going to the toilet do get into the habit of wiping yourself from front to back, as a thrush infection can easily be transferred from the bowel.     If you are still worried or have any further questions about the symptoms or the treatment, don’t hesitate to ask your doctor’s or pharmacist's advice.     HOW TO STORE YOUR MEDICINE    Use by date:   The expiry date is printed on one end of the carton (and also on the foil blister pack).  Do not use your medicine after this date.  Return any pessary that has gone past this date to your pharmacist (chemist).    Keep all medicines in a safe place, out of the reach of children.  Your Canesten 1 Pessary could harm them.     REMEMBER:   This medicine is for   you  .  It has been recommended by your doctor or pharmacist for the treatment of your symptoms.    Never   give it to someone else even if their symptoms are the same as yours.          ",

"        What you should know about Gemzar   Please read this leaflet carefully before you start your medicine. It does not contain ail the information about your medicine that you may need to know, so please ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you have any questions. This leaflet only applies to Gemzar.    What is in your medicine?   Your medicine is called Gemzar. Its active ingredient is gemcitabine hydrochloride. Gemzar also contains the inactive ingredients mannitol and sodium acetate.   Your medicine came from a glass bottle supplied to the hospital containing either 200 milligrams or 1 gram of gemcitabine hydrochloride powder.   A hospital pharmacist, nurse or doctor will have dissolved the Gemzar powder in sterile sodium chloride solution. This liquid is then passed from a bag or pump through a tube and needle into one of your veins. This is called an 'intravenous infusion'.   Gemzar is a 'cytotoxic' drug. Cytotoxic drugs kill cells which are dividing, including cancer cells.   Gemzar is made by Lilly France SA, Rue du Colonel Lilly, 67640 Fegersheim, France. The product licence holder is Eli Lilly and Company Limited, Dextra Court, Chapel Hill, Basingstoke, Hampshire, RG21 5SY     Why Gemzar?   Gemzar is used to treat patients who have lung cancer of the 'non-small cell' type. If your doctor gives you this medicine for anything else, ask him or her any questions you have about it.     Before you are treated with Gemzar    Your doctor will make sure it is safe for you to have Gemzar. Children should not have Gemzar.     If you answer YES to any of the following questions, or you are not sure, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.      Have you ever had an allergic reaction to Gemzar? (An allergic reaction may include rash, itching, swelling or breathing difficulties.)     Are you pregnant or could you be?     Are you breast-feeding?     Do you have kidney trouble or liver trouble?      These are some of the things your doctor will have thought about:   If you have a long infusion injection (more than 30 minutes) or a lot of infusion injections (more than once a week) it may cause more side effects.   Gemzar and most other cytotoxic drugs may affect the cells in your bone marrow. These cells divide very quickly to make new blood cells. Your doctor or nurse will take samples of your blood when you are treated with Gemzar. The hospital's laboratory will count the number of each different type of blood cell (platelets, white cells and red cells). Your doctor may decide to change the dose or put off treating you if your blood cell counts are too low. Your blood cell counts soon improve as your bone marrow makes new cells.   The laboratory will also check that your liver and kidneys are working normally because they remove Gemzar from the body. If they are not getting rid of it quickly enough your doctor may decide to stop giving you Gemzar.   Do not drive or use dangerous machinery if you feel tired.     Please read the back of this leaflet.      What you should know about Gemzar - continued   How Gemzar is used to treat you Usual dose      1000 milligrams for every square metre of your body's surface area.      Your nurse will measure your height and weight and work out the surface area of your body from these measurements. Your doctor will use this body surface area to work out the right dose for you.   The doctor will then inject the right amount of Gemzar solution into a vein over half an hour. This is only done once a week for three weeks (see picture). You will then not be treated with Gemzar for two weeks before you get your next 'treatment cycle'. Each four-week period is called a 'treatment cycle'.      When you will get your doses of Gemzar           You may get more than two 'treatment cycles'.     Gemzar must only go into a vein.     If you are being treated as an out-patient it is important that you go to the clinic for all your appointments.       While you are being treated   Gemzar may cause some side effects, these include:     low blood cell counts (these may cause symptoms such as fever, a sore throat, nose bleeds or bruising);     changes in your liver test results;     kidney test changes (you may get protein or blood in your urine);     feeling sick or being sick;     fluid retention (swelling in your hands, feet, legs and so on);     a flu-like condition which doesn't last long (fever, headache, pains and so on);     losing some of your hair;     feeling tired;     skin rashes, some may be itchy, but they are usually mild (more serious allergic reactions are very rare);     you becoming short of breath.     Your doctor should be able to give you something to treat any sickness or rash.     Other effects which have been seen in patients getting Gemzar are diarrhoea, constipation, and a sore mouth.     If you have these or any other side effects, tell your doctor He or she has more information about Gemzar and will tell you what to do.      How your medicine is stored   The hospital pharmacy should keep the bottles of Gemzar at room temperature (15-25ºC). They should not use a bottle after the Use before' date When Gemzar has been dissolved, the hospital should use it within 6 hours. The Gemzar solution should be kept at room temperature during that time. It should not be kept in a fridge.    Remember:   This medicine is for you. Only a doctor can prescribe it for you. Never give it to others It may harm them, even if their symptoms are the same as yours.

"      Climesse    The patient information leaflet for Climesse is in the form of a small booklet. The text below is the information that it contains.    This leaflet is a summary of information about your CLIMESSE tablets. Please read it carefully before you start taking them   If you would like any more information about your tablets, the menopause or Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT), after you have read this leaflet, speak to your doctor or pharmacist (chemist).    What is in your tablets?   The active ingredients in your tablets are oestradiol valerate (a type of oestrogen) and norethisterone (a type of progestogen). Oestrogens and progestogens are similar to the natural female sex hormones.   Each tablet contains 2 mg of oestradiol valerate USP and 0.7 mg of norethisterone BP.   The inactive ingredients in your tablets are lactose, maize starch, povidone, talc, magnesium stearate, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and propylene glycol. The colouring in the tablets is E171 and E172.   CLIMESSE is available as packs of one or three calendar packs. Each calendar pack contains 28 tablets and is marked with the days of the week. This helps you to remember to take your tablets.     How does CLIMESSE work?   CLIMESSE is a Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT). Your own level of the hormones oestrogen and progestogen fall during the menopause. The active ingredients in CLIMESSE supplement your natural hormones. This help to bring your level of oestrogen and progestogen back to their level before your menopause.     Who makes CLIMESSE?   CLIMESSE is made by CP Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Wrexham, Wales.   The company licenced to sell it in the UK is Sandoz Pharmaceuticals (UK) Limited, Frimley Business Park, Frimley, Camberley, Surrey, GU16 5SG.     What is CLIMESSE for?   Women usually reach the menopause between 45 and 55. There is a natural fall in the level of female sex hormones at this time. The fall in the levels of oestrogen and progestogen can cause unpleasant symptoms.   The menopause affects different women in different ways. Some have no symptoms, or very few, while others have many unpleasant symptoms. These can include: irregular, heavy or light periods; hot flushes, sweats, palpitations, and tingling in the hands and feet; discomfort or soreness during sexual intercourse (this is often due to vaginal dryness); pain when passing water and problems with bladder control; dizziness and headaches; tiredness, sleeplessness, depression and loss of interest in sex.   CLIMESSE helps to relieve these symptoms by supplementing the hormones which are lost at the menopause.   In later life, after the menopause some women develop a condition called osteoporosis, in which the bones lose calcium and become more likely to break. Your doctor may prescribe CLIMESSE to help prevent this condition.     Who can take CLIMESSE?   Read this section carefully to make sure that CLIMESSE is right for you. CLIMESSE is only meant for women who are past the menopause. It is not a contraceptive pill. It should not be used in children.   You should not take these tablets if:     you are pregnant, or think you might be, or you are breast feeding.     you have ever had breast cancer or any lumps in your breasts (unless your doctor has checked and found them to be harmless). Make sure that your doctor knows if any of your relations have had breast cancer.     you have ever had breast cancer or any lumps in your breasts (unless your doctor has checked and found them to be harmless). Make sure that your doctor knows if any of your relations have had breast cancer.      you have any other sort of cancer that is sensitive to hormones, or your doctor thinks you might have.     you have any unusual bleeding from your vagina that your doctor does not know about.     you have problems with your circulation or with your blood clotting too easily ('thrombosis' or 'embolism') at the moment. You might notice swollen sore red areas over your veins, or pains in your legs or chest when you walk.     you have severe heart, kidney or liver problems.     you suspect that you have had an allergic reaction to, or been upset by any of the ingredients of CLIMESSE (listed in 'What is in your tablets') you suspect that you have had an allergic reaction to, or been upset by any of the ingredients of CLIMESSE (listed in 'What is in your tablets')     Remember, if any of these apply to you, do not take CLIMESSE. Tell your doctor.   Your doctor also needs to know if you have any of these illnesses or problems:     gallstones, mild liver disease or a tendency to get jaundice, Dubin-Johnson syndrome or Rotor syndrome     porphyria (your urine turns dark red when it has been standing, and you get skin blisters and/or pains in your abdomen and muscles)     hearing loss due to 'otosclerosis' (a problem with the bones in your ear)     migraine (or other very bad headaches) or epilepsy     cysts or nodules in your breasts, or womb problems such as endometriosis or fibroids     multiple sclerosis     diabetes     systemic lupus erythematosus     high blood pressure (also known as hypertension) high blood pressure (also known as hypertension)     HRT could make these problems worse. Make sure your doctor knows if you have any of them. You may need extra check-ups before and during your treatment.     Are you taking any other medicines?   The hormones in CLIMESSE are to supplement your own natural hormones and are not likely to react with other medicines. However, you should always tell your doctor about any other medicines you are taking, including ones you have bought yourself.     Special advice   Contraception CLIMESSE is not a contraceptive pill. It may still be possible for you to become pregnant. If you are using an oral or other hormonal contraceptive, for example the 'pill' or depot injection, you must change to a non-hormonal method, for example, a diaphragm or condom, BEFORE you start your CLIMESSE tablets. However, women who take CLIMESSE should be past the age when they can have children, so if your doctor has already told you that you no longer need to use any form of contraception, you do not need to do so whilst taking CLIMESSE.    Accidents, illnesses and operations   If you have an accident, an illness or an operation which will keep you in bed or sitting still for a few days or more, remind your doctor that you are taking CLIMESSE. You may need to stop taking the tablets until you are mobile again. This is because your circulation can be affected. Tell your doctor about your accident, illness or operation as soon as you can.    Check-ups   Regular check-ups are important for women, not just women on HRT. Several illnesses do become more common as you get older. A check up before you start taking CLIMESSE and regularly while you are taking it mean that you and your doctor should notice any warning signs as early as possible. This gives you the best chance of tackling any problems successfully and keeping in good health.   Some checks are even more important for women before and during HRT. HRT may increase the risk of breast cancer very slightly if it is used for longer than five or ten years so it is especially important to check your breasts regularly. Your doctor or practice nurse can show you how to do this yourself each month. They may also check your breasts for you at your regular appointments. You may also have a breast   scan (a 'mammography') at your doctor's surgery or in hospital.   You may have an internal (vaginal) examination, your womb checked and regular cervical smear tests as well.   If you have mild liver disease, you will have your liver function checked regularly every 8 to 12 weeks. Likewise, if you have high blood pressure, your doctor will want to keep a special check on you.     How do you take CLIMESSE?   When should you take your first tablets? You should not start taking CLIMESSE until at least twelve months after your last natural period.   You should take one tablet each day.   If you have been taking other Hormone Replacement Therapy tablets, carry on until you have taken all the combined (oestrogen plus progestogen) tablets for the month. Usually this will be at the end of your calendar pack. Take your first CLIMESSE tablet the next day. Do not leave a break between your old tablets and the CLIMESSE tablets.   If you have not been taking other HRT preparations, start the tablets on any day. Try taking the tablets at the same time every day to help you remember.    How should you continue with CLIMESSE?   swallow one tablet each day. Start your next calendar pack of tablets the day after you finish your previous pack. Do not take a break between packs.     How long can you take CLIMESSE?   Your doctor will advise you about how long to carry on with HRT. Many women use it for several years. If your doctor has prescribed CLIMESSE to prevent osteoporosis then it's likely that you will carry on taking it for several years for any real benefit. Short term use may be sufficient for controlling the unpleasant symptoms associated with the menopause.     What if you take too many tablets?   Don't worry. It is unlikely to do you any harm. If you do have any unpleasant effects afterwards, tell your doctor.     What if you forget to take your tablets?   Don't worry. Just leave out the forgotten tablet or tablets. Take your next tablet at the right time.    What will happen to your periods while you are taking CLIMESSE?   Most women taking CLIMESSE do not have periods. This is quite normal and not a cause for concern. If you want to know more about this your doctor or pharmacist will be able to explain.   You may have some bleeding at odd times during the first few months. This can be a nuisance, but itusually stops after a few months. If you have any heavy bleeding or if bleeding occurs after the first few months when your periods have already stopped, tell your doctor. You may need a test to find out why you are having irregular bleeding.     Does CLIMESSE have side effects?   As with any medicine, CLIMESSE can sometimes have side-effects. Some find that their breasts feel tender or are enlarged whilst some women put on weight – this can be because of fluid retention.   HRT may cause wind, period or stomach pains, or a bloated feeling. It may also cause sickness or a feeling of sickness. Some women feel dizzy or irritable. Some get skin rashes or more vaginal fluid. Some women get high blood pressure or palpitations, and some get headaches or muscle cramps. Some women may experience a change in their sexual desire.   Tell your doctor and stop taking the tablets if you get repeated severe headaches or if you notice any symptoms of jaundice for example, yellowing of the whites of the eyes or skin.   Some women get spots and some may also feel tired or depressed.   If any side-effects worry you or do not go away, talk to your doctor.   If you notice any other changes while you are taking CLIMESSE, even if they are not listed here, tell your doctor.     Look after your tablets   Keep your tablets in the pack they came in. Do not take any tablets after the 'use-by' date on the pack.   Keep your tablets in a safe dry place where children cannot reach them. Keep them away from heat.   Only a doctor can prescribe CLIMESSE. Do not give your tablets to anyone else, even if they seem to have the same symptoms as you. This can be dangerous.   If you stop taking CLIMESSE before you have finished all the tablets, take any that are left back to the chemist.    PL: 0101/0396   This leaflet was last revised in September 1995.

'Augmentin' is an antibiotic for treating infections  It belongs to a group of antibiotics called ""penicillins"".  'Augmentin' works by killing the bacteria that can cause infections.      Why has your doctor prescribed 'Augmentin'?     ‘Augmentin’ can treat a wide range of bacterial infections including those of the chest (bronchitis or pneumonia), tonsils (tonsillitis). sinuses (sinusitis). ears, skin, the bladder or the urethra (the tube which carries urine from the bladder), kidneys, teeth and gums (abscesses), and bone and joints.    Before taking your medicine      Let your doctor know if any of the following apply to you:     You have ever had a skin rash or swelling of the face or neck when taking any antibiotic.     You know you are allergic to penicillin (or any other antibiotic).     You have ever had a serious complaint – such as liver problems – when taking an antibiotic.     You are taking a contraceptive pill (in which case you will need to take extra contraceptive precautions such as using a condom).     You are pregnant, think you might be pregnant, or are breast-feeding.     You are being treated for kidney or liver problems.     You have glandular fever.     You are taking any medicine (such as warfarin) to prevent blood clots.     You are under 12 years of age (or the patient is under 12 years of age).

How to take   '  Augmentin  '   Your doctor will tell you how many tablets you should take.  Usually you have to take the tablets three times a day.  Your doctor's instructions are on the label of the tablets' container, so read it carefully.  If you have any questions, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.   You should swallow ‘Augmentin’ tablets whole with water – don’t chew them.      For the best results, take 'Augmentin' just before meals.    Try to take your tablets so that it becomes part of your daily routine, for example at meal times.    But remember, whenever you take your tablets, space the doses as evenly as possible through the day.    Try not to take more than one dose every four hours and never take two doses within one hour or so       Keep on taking the tablets, even if you feel better.    You need every tablet to help you fight off the infection.  If you stop taking your tablets before the end of the course, some bacteria may survive and cause the infection to come back.   If you still feel unwell after finishing the treatment, go and see your doctor.    Never take more than the recommended dose each day.      What if I forget to take a dose?   If you forget to take a tablet, take it as soon as you remember.  Then carry on as before.  Try to wait about four hours before taking the next dose.  Do not take two doses within one hour or so.     What if I take too much?   If you have taken too many tablets all at once, contact your doctor or local hospital casualty department at once.  Show the doctor your pack of tablets.    Information on possible side effects   A few people may find this medicine upsets their stomach or gives them diarrhoea.  The symptoms are usually mild and you may prevent them by taking the tablets just before meals.   Some people get a rash when they take antibiotics.  If you start to itch or get a rash, stop taking 'Augmentin' and tell your doctor at once.  Other side effects include a swollen face and breathing problems.  But these are extremely rare.  Tell your doctor straight away if you notice any of these symptoms.   Some people may get thrush (a yeast infection of the vagina, mouth or skin folds) after or during treatment.

"      Premarin Conjugated oestrogens   Please read this leaflet carefully before you start to take your tablets. The leaflet contains basic information about Premarin tablets which have been prescribed for you by your doctor. If you have any questions or are unsure about anything, ask your doctor or pharmacist.    What is in my tablets?   The name of your medicine is Premarin. It contains a mixture of natural hormones called conjugated oestrogens. Premarin is available in three different strengths: the maroon tablets contain 0.625 mg conjugated oestrogens, the yellow tablets contain 1.25 mg conjugated oestrogens and the purple tablets contain 2.5 mg conjugated oestrogens.   Premarin tablets also contain lactose, methylcellulose, magnesium stearate, sucrose, glyceryl monoleate, polyethylene glycol, carnauba wax, calcium sulphate anhydrous, microcrystalline cellulose, pharmaceutical glaze (shellac), sodium benzoate, polyvinylpyrrolidone and titanium dioxide(E171).   Dyes are used to colour the tablets:   maroon tablets: E110, E132, E127.   yellow tablets: E104, E110.   purple tablets: E127, E132.   The maroon tablets (0.625 mg) and the yellow tablets (1.25 mg)are supplied in calendar blister packs each pack containing three strips of 28 tablets of the same colour.   Premarin is one of a group of medicines called Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT), and is used to treat some of the symptoms of the menopause or ""change of life"".    Product licence holder:   John Wyeth and Brother Limited trading as Wyeth Laboratories, Huntercombe Lane South, Taplow, Maidenhead, Berks SL6 0PH.    Manufacturer:   Wyeth Medical Ireland, Little Connell Newbridge, Co. Kildare, Republic of Ireland.     What are my tablets used for?   During the menopause, the level of the oestrogen in your body will decrease. Oestrogen is one of the main hormones responsible for maintaining your normal menstrual cycle. As the amount of oestrogen produced by your body decreases, the menstrual cycle may become irregular and a period may only occur once every few months. Eventually your periods will stop altogether.   Oestrogen is also responsible for helping to keep many tissues in the body healthy, such as the skin, bones, urinary system and the lining of the vagina. The lack of oestrogen which causes the menopause is also responsible for many of the unpleasant symptoms you have at this time. By replacing the oestrogen that your body no longer produces, Premarin can relieve some of these symptoms, such as hot flushes, night sweats and vaginal dryness. It can also help to prevent bone thinning (osteoporosis).   Premarin is usually prescribed for women who have had their womb removed (hysterectomy). However, women who have not had this operation can still take Premarin and their doctor will prescribe a second type of tablet containing another hormone called a progestogen, to be taken 12-14 days per month as well as the Premarin tablets.    If you have not had a hysterectomy you should not take Premarin without an additional progestogen tablet for 12-14 days each month.    HRT is hormone   replacement   therapy. It provides low doses of oestrogen to replace the hormone your body is no longer providing. The lack of oestrogen in your body results in many of the unpleasant symptoms of the menopause; by replacing the oestrogen with HRT these symptoms can be relieved.      Are there reasons for not taking HRT?   You should not take Premarin if:     You know or suspect you are pregnant, or you are breast feeding.     You have or have had breast cancer.     You are suffering from a disorder which causes clotting in the blood vessels.     You have any abnormal vaginal bleeding.     You have serious liver disease.     You have serious heart or kidney disease.     You are allergic to any of the ingredients of Premarin tablets.       What should I know before taking my tablets?   Some studies with HRT have shown a small increased risk of breast cancer where HRT has been used over a long period of time. Other studies, however, have not shown this link. Whilst taking HRT you should regularly check your breasts and tell your doctor if you find any lumps.   If you have a history of breast lumps, your doctor will regularly check your breasts for any changes.   If you have not had a hysterectomy you should be aware that there is an increased risk of cancer of the lining of the womb (endometrium) associated with taking oestrogen-only HRT like Premarin. Your doctor will prescribe additional tablets containing a progestogen for 12-14 days each month to remove this risk.   If you have suffered from blood clots in your legs or lungs, a stroke or heart attack, your doctor will monitor you closely.   It is unlikely that HRT will affect your blood pressure. Your doctor will monitor your blood pressure at your regular check ups, especially if you are already being treated for high blood pressure.     Special warnings   Certain diseases may be made worse by HRT. If you have any of the following conditions your doctor will monitor you closely: otosclerosis multiple sclerosis systemic lupus erythematosis, porphyria, melanoma thyrotoxicosis, diabetes, depression, asthma, migraine, epilepsy, fibroids or endometriosis. Tell your doctor if you notice any change in your condition whilst taking Premarin.   The risk of gall bladder disease is slightly increased in women taking HRT.   HRT may affect some medical tests. If you visit a hospital or clinic for any medical tests you should tell the doctor concerned that you are taking HRT.     Is Premarin like the contraceptive Pill?   No. The contraceptive Pill uses higher doses of synthetic hormones to prevent ovulation and fertilisation of eggs. Premarin is NOT a contraceptive. It is important that you use a reliable form of non hormonal contraception if there is any possibility that you may still become pregnant. You should discuss this with your doctor.     My periods have stopped. Will they start again whilst taking Premarin?   No not if you have had a hysterectomy, you will be taking an additional progestogen tablet for 12-14 days each month, and you will probably have a ""period"", or withdrawal bleed, each month, at about the time you finish the additional progestogen tablets. This is caused by the hormones and is perfectly natural. Some women taking ""combined HRT"" (oestrogen plus the additional progestogen) may experience a gradual reduction in withdrawal bleeding and it may eventually stop, this is quite normal. If you have heavy or irregular bleeding you should tell your doctor.     Will Premarin affect my driving?   There is no evidence to suggest that taking Premarin will affect your ability to drive or to operate machinery.     How do I take my tablets   You may start your first pack at any convenient time. The usual dose is one tablet per day, to be swallowed with a drink of water.   Do not leave a break between packs unless your doctor tells you to. Do not stop taking Premarin without first discussing it with your doctor.       How long do I need to take Premarin for?   That really depends on why you and your doctor have decided on a course of treatment. If you are taking HRT to relieve your immediate menopausal symptoms like hot flushes and night sweats, you may be prescribed HRT for between three to twelve months or longer. If, however, you or your doctor are worried about osteoporosis and you wish to protect yourself now for the future, you may be prescribed HRT for between five to ten years or even longer.     What if I miss a tablet or tablets?   If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember, then go on as before. If more than one tablet has been missed take the tablet for the day that you remember and continue as normal.     What if I take too many tablets?   Do not worry. Premarin contains natural hormones and it is unlikely that serious problems will occur. If in any doubt, consult your doctor or pharmacist.   You may feel some nausea (sickness), or experience a short period of vaginal bleeding (unless you have had a hysterectomy) if you take too many tablets.     Can I wash off the coating or crush the tablets?   It is best not to try to take off the coating or crush the tablets, as this could affect the way Premarin works. The dyes used are approved for use as food colourings. They are needed so that Premarin can be identified from other tablets, and so that the different strengths of Premarin can be easily recognised.     Are there any side effects?   Report these or any other unusual side effects to your doctor immediately:     a sudden loss or change in vision.     a first migraine attack.     shortness of breath.     sharp pains in the chest.     jaundice.     red, painful, swollen calves.     Premarin may cause some unwanted effects, most of which are not serious and you need only tell your doctor if you are troubled by any of the following symptoms.     Swollen, tender breasts.     A tendency to thrush, vaginal discharge and urinary infections such as cystitis.     Mild stomach upsets, feeling or being sick, a feeling of being bloated, stomach cramps.     Rashes or discolouration, swellings or red patches on the skin, loss of or increases in hair.     Minor eye changes which may cause difficulties if you wear contact lenses.     Headaches, dizziness, mood changes, muscular twitches.     Weight changes, changes in appetite.     Changes in sex drive (libido).     Leg cramps.     You should also tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice any other unwanted effects whilst you are taking Premarin.     How do I store my tablets?   Keep out of reach of children.   Do not use this medicine after the date stated on the packaging.   If the pack has been opened or damaged return it to your pharmacist.   Do not let anyone else take your Premarin tablets even if they seem to have the same problem as you— it may harm them.   Return any unused medicine to your pharmacist.   Only keep it if your doctor tells you to.    Date of preparation:   November 1995.     ",

"    PATIENT INFORMATION LEAFLET   PLEASE READ THIS LEAFLET CAREFULLY BEFORE USING    KOGENATE 1000    What does KOGENATE contain?   KOGENATE is a freeze-dried powder which contains 1000 International Units (IU) of Factor VIII (rDNA) (bhk).   It contains also human albumin, glycine, calcium chloride and 18 mg of sodium chloride. KOGENATE must be dissolved in the Water for Injections supplied before it is administered.   This box contains one 10 ml vial of freeze-dried KOGENATE powder.   You should have received another box connected to this box which contains:   One 10 ml vial containing 2.5 ml of Water for Injections.   Two sterile alcohol swabs for single use.      A blister pack containing:    One plastic syringe.   One venepuncture set.   One filter needle.   One transfer device.   The vial will appear to be only partially full but this is normal and does not mean that it contains the wrong amount of powder.   KOGENATE 1000 contains Factor VlIl and is to be used to stop and/or prevent the bleeding you get with haemophilia A.   The Factor VlIl in KOGENATE is made by the process of genetic engineering as indicated by the initials (rDNA) (bhk) used above.     Product Licence/Authorisation Holder:   Manufacturer:     Bayer plc Bayer House Strawberry Hill Newbury Berkshire RG13 1JA Bayer AG Leverkusen Germany    Why have I been prescribed KOGENATE by my doctor?   KOGENATE has been prescribed by your doctor to stop and/or prevent the bleeding you might get with haemophilia A.   Haemophilia A is a disease which results because your body does not produce enough Factor VlIl.  Factor VlIl is a component in the blood which helps it to clot when you are bleeding.  If the level of Factor VlIl is low in your blood, your body will have difficulty in stopping bleeding.   You can use KOGENATE if you have never been treated for haemophilia before, or if you have previously been treated for haemophilia and have no antibodies to Factor VlIl (inhibitors) which would neutralise Factor VlIl in your blood.   If you have been using KOGENATE and you develop Factor VlIl inhibitors, treatment may be continued as long as you still respond to KOGENATE and the inhibitors in your blood remain below a certain level (10 Bethesda Units).  Speak to your doctor if you would like further information about this.   This product does not contain von Willebrand Factor, so it cannot be used in von Willebrand’s disease.     When should I not use KOGENATE 1000?   Do not use KOGENATE if you are allergic to any of the ingredients.  If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor.   If you know that you are allergic to mouse or hamster protein, KOGENATE should not be used.  Consult your doctor if you are unsure about this.  Usually, if you are allergic to KOGENATE, a reaction will occur upon first use of the product.  Allergic reactions can occur at the injection site such as a burning sensation, temporary redness or a rash or you may experience nausea, dizziness or a tight chest.     What special precautions should I take?   If you think that you are having an allergic reaction to KOGENATE, stop administering the product immediately and seek medical advice.  Speak to your doctor regularly about your treatment.  He/she may wish to carry out tests to ensure that your current dose of KOGENATE is sufficient to reach and maintain adequate Factor VlIl levels.   If your bleeding is not being controlled with KOGENATE, consult your doctor immediately.  You may have developed Factor VlIl inhibitors and your doctor may wish to carry out tests to confirm this.  Factor VlIl inhibitors are antibodies in the blood which act against the Factor VlIl you are using.  This makes the Factor VlIl less effective in controlling bleeding.   If you are pregnant, planning a family or are breast-feeding, tell your doctor before using this product.  If you have informed your doctor already, follow his/her instructions carefully.   There is no evidence that Factor VlIl may impair your ability to drive or to use machines.     How much KOGENATE 1000 should I use?   The amount of KOGENATE you use and how often you use it depends on many factors such as your weight, the severity of your haemophilia, the site and extent of bleeding, the amount of Factor VlIl inhibitors that you may have and the Factor VIII level required.   Your doctor will calculate the dose of KOGENATE and the frequency you should use it to get the necessary level of Factor VlIl activity in your blood.  He will do this according to   your   particular needs using the formulae below.   I)To determine the dose required for a given response:   Required IU = body weight (kg) x desired Factor VlIl rise (% of normal) x 0 5   II)To determine the response expected from a given dose:      Expected Factor VlIl rise (% of normal) = 2 x administered IU body weight (kg)   If you are infusing KOGENATE to stop a bleeding episode, the amount of KOGENATE you will need depends on the site and extent of your bleeding.  For example, if you are suffering a minor haemorrhage, such as bleeding into a joint, the plasma level of Factor VlIl activity should not fall below 30 % of normal for at least one day.  If your bleeding is more severe or you need an operation, the dose of KOGENATE and time of usage will increase.   If you are using KOGENATE to prevent bleeding (PROPHYLAXIS), your doctor will calculate the dose for you.  This will usually be in the range of 10 to 50 IU of KOGENATE per kg of body weight administered at intervals of 2 to 3 days.  However, in some cases, especially younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.   If you have a large number of Factor VlIl inhibitors, the dose of KOGENATE you are given by your doctor will be high to maintain the correct Factor VlIl activity in your blood.  If this dose does not control your bleeding your doctor may consider the use of an additional product (activated) prothrombin complex concentrate.  Speak to your doctor if you would like further information about this.    How do I administer KOGENATE 1000?   If you have been prescribed KOGENATE to use at home, your doctor will have ensured that you know how to administer it.    If you are in any doubt about using KOGENATE, go back to your doctor for further advice and training before attempting to administer your treatment.    Follow the directions given by your doctor closely and use the instructions below as a guide:     Wash your hands thoroughly using soap and warm water.     Without opening either vial, warm the KOGENATE powder and the Water for Injections to room temperature.  This can be done by taking the vials from the fridge and allowing them to stand in a room for approximately one hour or, if needed to treat a bleed sooner, the vials can be warmed by holding them in your hands.             DO NOT leave the vials by a direct source of heat such as a radiator or fire in order to warm them quickly and try not to shake the vials KOGENATE must never be heated to more than 37ºC (body temperature)     Carefully remove the protective caps from both vials and clean each of the rubber stoppers with the sterile swabs supplied (diagram   A  )    IMPORTANT:   Use a fresh swab for each stopper.   An antiseptic spray may also be used and this can be purchased from your local pharmacist (chemist).     Stand the transfer device on a clean surface   making sure that the corrugated edge of the sleeve is facing upward.   (diagram   B  ).     Turn the vial containing Water for Injections upside down and mount it onto the transfer device (diagram   C  ).  Press them together firmly and then immediately place the combined Water for Injections vial and transfer device on top of the vial containing the KOGENATE powder.  Press into place firmly and then hold the three components in place until all the water has been drawn into the vial containing powder (diagram   D  ).     Remove the water vial and transfer device and dispose of them carefully Ask your doctor how.     Swirl the powder vial gently until all of the KOGENATE powder is dissolved and you have a clear solution (diagram   E  ).  Do not shake the vial vigorously.      Make sure that all of the powder has dissolved before going on to the next step    IMPORTANT Once the powder is dissolved in water, the solution must be used within four hours.      ",
"      Pepcid (famotidine, MSD)   PLEASE READ BOTH SIDES OF THIS LEAFLET CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU START TO TAKE YOUR TABLETS.   Keep this leaflet. You may want to read it again.    What is in your tablets?    Active ingredient   The active ingredient in Pepcid Tablets is famotidine USP. The beige-coloured tablets contain 20 mg famotidine and the brown-coloured tablets contain 40 mg famotidine.     Other ingredients   Carnuba wax EP; magnesium stearate EP; pregelatinised maize starch BP; hydroxypropylcellulose EP; hypromellose EP; red iron oxide E172; yellow iron oxide E172; talc EP; titanium dioxide E171; microcrystalline cellulose EP.   Famotidine is available in calendar packs containing 28 tablets. Sample packs containing 2 and 4 tablets are also available.      How do your tablets work?   The active ingredient in your tablets is famotidine (either 20 or 40 mg). This belongs to a group of medicines called 'H2-blockers' which work by reducing the amount of acid you produce in your stomach and so help improve your condition.     Who makes your tablets?   Your tablets are made by Merck Manufacturing Division, Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited, Shotton Lane, Cramlington, Northumberland, for Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited, Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, UK, who hold the Product Licence in the UK and the Product Authorisation in Eire.     Why do you need to take these tablets?   Your doctor has prescribed Pepcid for you to treat the acid condition in your stomach. The amount of acid in your stomach may have resulted in:     the development of an ulcer in your stomach (gastric ulcer)or the first part of your small intestine attached to your stomach (duodenal ulcer).     gastro-oesophageal reflux disease - a condition caused when stomach acid and food from the stomach go back up (reflux) into the food pipe (oesophagus).     Your doctor may also have prescribed Pepcid for you to treat a rare condition called 'Zollinger-Ellison syndrome' in which the stomach produces an excessive amount of acid.   Pepcid will help reduce the amount of acid you are producing, allow healing of ulcers, and give you relief from your symptoms. Pepcid may also be used to decrease the chance that a duodenal ulcer or the symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease will come back.     Are there patients who should not take these tablets?   Yes; do not take the tablets if:     you are or think you may be pregnant.     you are planning to become pregnant.     you are breast-feeding.     you have had a bad reaction to this or similar medicines or to any of the ingredients in the past.     If you think any of these apply to you, do not take the tablets, go and talk to your doctor first and follow his advice.   Pepcid Tablets should not be given to children.     What else should you know about taking your tablets?   You should check with your doctor before taking 'Pepcid' if you have kidney problems.     Can you take Pepcid with other medicines?   Pepcid does not usually interfere with other medicines you may be taking It is important, however, that you tell your doctor about all the medicines you are taking,  including those obtained without a doctor's prescription.     How should you take Pepcid?    For the treatment of an ulcer:   You should take your tablets exactly as advised by your doctor or pharmacist. The number of tablets you take each day will depend upon your condition and whether you have kidney problems. For many people this is one 40 mg tablet, swallowed with a drink of water, at night.

BEFORE TAKING YOUR MEDICINE     If you are pregnant (or intending to become pregnant),     If you are breast feeding a baby,     If you have ever had to stop taking another medicine for this illness because you were allergic to it or it caused problems,     TELL YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE STARTING TO TAKE THIS MEDICINE.  In some circumstances this medicine may not be suitable and your doctor may wish to give you a different medicine.     Are you having treatment for a thyroid condition?     Are you having treatment for raised blood pressure or a heart problem?     If the answer is YES to either of these questions tell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you have not already done so.   Make sure that your doctor knows what other medicines you are taking.     TAKING YOUR MEDICINE     REMEMBER the medicine in Ventodisks is not swallowed but should only be inhaled into your lungs using a special kind of inhaler called a Ventolin Diskhaler inhaler.  Make sure that you have one and can use it properly.  If you have any difficulties or do not understand the leaflet that comes with it ask your doctor or pharmacist.     It is important that you inhale each dose from a Ventodisk as instructed by your doctor.  The label will usually tell you what dose to take and how often.  If it doesn’t or you are not sure, ask your doctor or pharmacist.      DOSE   Usually the most you would take in a 24 hour period is:   Adults – 1600 micrograms, Children – 800 micrograms,   BUT YOU MUST NOT inhale more doses or use your Diskhaler more often than your doctor advises.  If your wheezing or breathing is very bad your doctor may tell you to take more as an emergency treatment.    IF YOU MISS A DOSE     If you forget to inhale a dose do not worry; just inhale the next dose when it is due or before if you become wheezy.  Your doctor may have told you to use your inhaler regularly every day or only when you are wheezy or short of breath.

AFTER TAKING YOUR MEDICINE     If you notice a sudden worsening of your shortness of breath and wheeze shortly after using your inhaler tell your doctor as soon as possible.     IF THE RELIEF OF WHEEZING OR CHEST TIGHTNESS IS NOT AS GOOD AS USUAL OR DOES NOT LAST FOR AS LONG AS USUAL, TELL YOUR DOCTOR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  IT MAY BE THAT YOUR CHEST CONDITION IS GETTING WORSE AND PERHAPS YOU MAY NEED AN EXTRA MEDICINE.       Very occasionally some people feel a little shaky or have a headache.  Muscle cramps can occur although these are quite rare.  These effects usually wear off with continued treatment.  Tell your doctor but do not stop using the medicine unless told to do so.

If you are still having fairly regular periods, start using Estrapak within 5 days of the start of bleeding.  If you have no periods or irregular periods, you can start using Estrapak at any time.     You may find it helpful to stick the 'day of the week' sticker beginning with your first day of treatment in the space on the inside cover of the carton.

Whilst you are using Estrapak you need to wear a patch all the time, changing it twice a week as shown on the calendar.  Each patch can be left in place for 3 to 4 days.  It is best to change your patch on the same two days each week.         You also need to take one tablet a day for 12 consecutive days as shown on the calendar.  We recommend taking the tablets from Day 15 through to Day 26.     You may find that you have some irregular bleeding or spotting during the first month or so of treatment.  Once your treatment has become settled, you will probably have a 'period' each  month starting on about day 24- 26.  This is quite normal.  If, however, you continue to have irregular bleeding or spotting, tell your doctor.     When you finish an Estrapak pack, start the next pack straightaway.  There is no need to have a break between packs.         Putting on a patch     Remove the sachet from the box and tear it open at the notch. Use your fingers because cutting with scissors might damage the patch inside. You must   never   cut or tear your patches in any way.         Take out the transparent patch and loosen the backing by rubbing the edge of the patch between your thumb and forefinger.  The stiff protective liner will peel away from the flexible, sticky patch.           Stick the patch onto a hairless area of skin below the waist.  Most patients find that the buttock is the best place and that skin irritation is less likely to occur at this site.  You could also try the lower back, hip, abdomen or upper thigh.    Never put a patch on or near the breasts.    Choose a clean, dry area of skin. Avoid skin which is red or irritated.       Never powder or oil your skin before putting on a patch as it may not stick properly.     Place the sticky patch on the area of skin you have chosen and press it firmly into position with the palm of your hand while you count up to 10.  Pressing for a few seconds will make it stick securely.  Run your finger around the edge of the patch to make sure that the edges stick.      Provided that you have applied the patch correctly, you can bathe, shower or swim with little risk of the patch coming off.     If the patch does come off in the bath or shower, just shake it to remove any water, dry the skin thoroughly and put it on again in the usual way.     When the time comes to change your patch, take off the old one,   fold it in half with the sticky side inwards, and throw it away carefully out of the reach of children. Remember, it will still contain some medication.      Always place your new patch on a fresh area of skin.      If you forget to change the patch at the right time, you should change it as soon as possible.  Then change to your next patch on the normal day.       Taking the tablets     Take one tablet a day for 12 consecutive days as shown on the calendar.     Try to take the tablet at roughly the same time each day.     You should always take all 12 tablets each month. If you forget   to take one or more tablets, keep the missed tablets and take them at the end of the 12 day course. Do not take more than one tablet a day.        After using your medication   This treatment sometimes causes unwanted effects in some people:     Headaches, nausea or breast tenderness.     Cramping pains in the calf.     Feeling slightly bloated.     Slight redness and itching of the skin where a patch has been.  This usually disappears within 3-4 days of taking off the patch.     These effects are often mild and may wear off after a few weeks' treatment.  If they are very troublesome and do not improve tell your doctor.     Very rarely, a more severe skin reaction can occur. If this happens, tell your doctor.   You should also tell your doctor if you have irregular bleeding or spotting after the first month or so of treatment.     Other useful information      Sunbathing - always make sure  your patch is covered by clothing.     Using a sun bed - either cover up your patch as above or take it off and put it back on after your shower when your skin is completely cool and dry.     Swimming - you can wear your patch beneath your swimming costume during swimming.     Never stick on a patch straight   after a hot bath or shower. Wait a while for the skin to become completely cool and dry.       Precautions   Whilst you are receiving Estrapak you should have regular check-ups with your doctor.  He or she will tell you how often this should be done.       REMEMBER:   this medicine is for   YOU  .  Only a doctor can prescribe it for you. Never give it to someone else.  It may harm them even if they have the same symptoms as you.     This leaflet is produced in accordance with guidance issued by the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry.

"    NEBUHALER WITH MASK         FOR USE WITH   Bricanyl  OR    Pulmicort    REFILL CANISTERS    PLEASE KEEP THIS LEAFLET SAFELY    ABOUT YOUR NEBUHALER ABOUT YOUR NEBUHALER      Nebuhaler makes it easy for your child’s medicine to be breathed down into the lungs, where it is needed.   It contains a ONE–WAY VALVE.  This means that when the inhaler canister is pressed down, the spray of medicine released will   stay inside   Nebuhaler until you are ready to give it to your child.   The valve only OPENS UP when Nebuholer is tilted upwards.  This lets the medicine   flow out   of Nebuhaler, through the valve and into the mask.  Your child will then breathe it down into their lungs.     ABOUT YOUR MASK ABOUT YOUR MASK   The mask included with Nebuholer is designed to help you to give the medicine to your child. it con help them to breathe in more of their medicine than if Nebuholer was used on its own.      CLEANING INSTRUCTIONS   It is very important that both the Nebuhaler and mask are cleaned regularly.   They should be taken apart and washed at least once or twice each week in warm soapy water.   To make washing easier the mask should be taken off the Nebuhaler.   Nebuhaler can then be taken apart as follows:–     Remove the canister from the white plastic holder before washing .     Pull out the white canister holder.     Press in, at the same time, the two round lugs near the middle of the Nebuhaler.      Twist the two halves, and pull them apart.     Lastly, pull off the mouthpiece.     After washing, allow all of the parts to dry out completely.  You may find that leaving them in a warm airing cupboard will speed this up.     HOW TO RE–ASSEMBLE NEBUHALER   Push the mouthpiece carefully back onto its seat.  Then ease the two halves back together, making sure that both of the round lugs have clicked back into their holes.   Push the white canister holder back into place.   Finally, replace the canister into the holder.    FOLLOW   THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE CAREFULLY        INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING NEBUHALER WITH MASK               Remove the mask from its wrapper.     Gently ease it onto the mouthpiece of Nebuhaler.   Make sure that it is fitted as in the diagram, with the long edge at the bottom. (If required, the mask can be made softer by placing it in warm water for a few seconds.)     Shake Nebuhaler well, to mix up the contents of the canister.     Bring Nebuhaler up to your child’s face.  The mask should be a loose fit over the mouth and nose.  It should not be pressed firmly against  the face.          REPEAT STEPS 6 AND 7 IF THE DOCTOR HAS TOLD YOU TO GIVE YOUR CHILD MORE DOSES.        Nebuhaler should now be held in o tilted position, as if you were bottle feeding a baby. This will make sure that the one-way valve is open.     Press the canister down once, to release a dose of medicine into Nebuhaler     Hold the mask to the face for 1-2 minutes. This will let most of the medicine flow from Nebuhaler, down into the mask, from where your child con breathe it in.      NEBUHALER   Two different types of medicine can be used with Nebuhaler.  These are Bricanyl and Pulmicort, which are both available in canisters.  Your doctor may have prescribed one or both of these   Make sure that you follow your doctor’s instructions carefully, and if your child has been prescribed both types of canister take care not to get them mixed up.   Bricanyl acts by opening up the airways quickly to make breathing easier when your child feels wheezy or tight chested.   Pulmicort is designed to help prevent the attack and must be used regularly at the dose and times recommended by your  doctor.  It will not help once on attack has started so do not give your child extra doses. However, you should still carry on using Pulmicort at the prescribed times.   CONTACT YOUR DOCTOR AS A MATTER OF URGENCY IF:     Your child’s breathing is getting worse.     They are not getting relief from the current dose.     They frequently wake up at night with asthma.     They develop chest tightness in the morning or it lasts for longer than usual     Don’t wait until the canister runs out before you ask your doctor for a new one.    Nebuhaler should be replaced about every 6 months.    CAUTION - The aerosol canister is pressurised - keep away from heat and direct sun.  Do not incinerate.  The valve should not be tampered with.      ",

"      Marvelon   This leaflet is designed to help you take Marvelon. Please read it carefully. If you still have any doubts about how to take Marvelon, please ask your doctor.    Introduction   There are several means of preventing a pregnancy. One of these is by taking the pill. When taken correctly, the pill has several important advantages over other methods of contraception.     It is one of the most reliable methods.     Once you stop taking the pill you will be able to become pregnant.     You can have sex without having to take other contraceptive measures directly beforehand.     Period pains may become less severe or may completely disappear.     Some disorders appear less frequently in pill users such as anaemia, pelvic infections, pregnancies occurring outside the womb, and certain disorders of the womb, ovaries and breasts.      N.B.   The information in this leaflet only concerns Marvelon.   For information on any other contraceptive pill read the leaflet about that pill.     How Marvelon works   You take Marvelon once a day for 21 days on the run. This provides a small amount of female sex hormones. These hormones are intended to prevent the monthly release of an egg from the ovaries. If an egg is not released you cannot become pregnant. The first 21 days are followed by 7 days when you don-t take a pill. During these pill-free days your regular 'monthly period' occurs. However, this period may be lighter and shorter than usual.     How effective is Marvelon?   Marvelon is one of the most reliable methods of contraception   if taken correctly  . To make Marvelon as effective as it can be   remember  :     To take it at about the same time every day (See the section 'What to do . . . if you forget to take a pill').     To use another contraceptive method as well if you miss a pill or are sick, have severe diarrhoea, or are taking medicines (especially antibiotics) which may interfere with the way the pill works. (See the section 'What to do ... if you have a stomach upset or diarrhoea', and the section 'What to do . . . if you have to take other medicines').       Starting your first Marvelon pack If you are not taking the pill at present   If your period has not yet begun read section 1.    If your period has begun in the last 5 days read section 2   If it is more than 5 days since your period began read section 3.     Wait for your next period to begin. (Until then take extra contraceptive precautions). On the first day of this period take your first Marvelon pill marked with the corresponding day of the week. Continue to take the pills as instructed in the section 'How to take Marvelon' below. As long as you do this, you don't need to take any other contraceptive precautions.     If you don't have this period, consult your doctor to make sure you are not pregnant. Until the result of the pregnancy test arrives,   do not take Marvelon   but take extra contraceptive precautions.   Read the section 'Extra contraceptive precautions' carefully.     Count the first day of your period as day 1. If it is now day 2, day 3 or day 4 of your period, you should begin taking your pills on day 5, regardless of whether bleeding has stopped or not. Take your first pill as instructed in the section 'How to take Marvelon' below.     You will   not   be protected against pregnancy for the first 7 days of pill taking; you must take extra contraceptive precautions. Read the section 'Extra contraceptive precautions' carefully.      If your period started more than 5 days ago, wait until the first day of your next period before starting to take Marvelon. In the meantime you must take extra contraceptive precautions. Read the section 'Extra contraceptive precautions' carefully.        How to take Marvelon   The Marvelon pack contains 21 white pills. On the day you start a new pack of Marvelon, take a pill marked with the corresponding day of the week. For example, if it is Wednesday, take the pill marked Wednesday on the upper row of the pack. Follow the direction of the arrows and continue taking one pill each day until the pack is empty - that is for 21 days in all. Take your pill at the same time each day, preferably in the evening. Swallow each pill whole, with water if necessary.     Your next packs   When you have finished all 21 pills, don-t take any more for 7 days. You will probably have a period during these 7 days. Start your next pack on the 8th day. Do this whether or not you are still bleeding or even if you have not had a period. Providing you take Marvelon correctly, you will always start each new pack on the same day of the week. You will not become pregnant during the 7 day break from taking the pill, as long as you have taken your pills correctly, and start the next Marvelon pack on time.     When you change from other pills   1. Changing to Marvelon from a 22-day pill with 6 days break or from another 21 -day pill with 7 days break.   Finish all the pills in your old pack. Take your first Marvelon pill the next day. Do not leave a gap between packs and do not wait for your period to begin. Continue taking Marvelon as instructed in the section 'How to take Marvelon', above. You don't need extra contraceptive precautions.   You will not have a period until the end of the Marvelon pack, but this is not harmful, nor does it matter if you notice some bleeding while taking the pills.     Changing from a combined every-day (ED) pill (28 pills) to Marvelon. Each every-day pack contains either 21 or 22 active pills followed by either 7 or 6 dummy (inactive) pills.     When you have taken all the   active   pills in your every day pack (21 or 22 pills) start taking Marvelon the next day. Do not leave a gap between taking your every day pill and starting Marvelon. Throw away the remaining inactive pills (6 or 7). Continue taking Marvelon as instructed in the section 'How to take Marvelon', above. You don't need extra contraceptive precautions.   You will not have a period until the end of the Marvelon pack, but this is not harmful, nor does it matter if you notice some bleeding while taking the pills.   3. Changing from a progestogen-only pill (POP or mini-pill) to Marvelon. (POP pills are taken every day without a break).   Start taking Marvelon on the first day of your period  , even if you have taken a mini-pill on that day  . Throw away the remaining pills in the POP pack. Continue to take Marvelon as instructed in the section 'How to take Marvelon', above. You don't need to take extra contraceptive precautions.   You may not have a period while taking the mini-pill, especially if you are breast-feeding. Start taking Marvelon the day after you stop taking the mini-pills. Throw away all the remaining mini-pills. You must take extra contraceptive precautions for the first 2 days of taking Marvelon .   Read the section 'Extra contraceptive precautions' carefully.     EXTRA CONTRACEPTIVE PRECAUTIONS     When you need extra contraceptive precautions, either:      don't have sex; or       use a cap plus spermicide or a condom       Don't use rhythm methods as extra contraceptive precautions. This is because the pill disrupts the usual menstrual cycle changes such as changes in temperature and cervical mucus.        After a baby   If you have just had a baby and you are not breastfeeding, your doctor may advise you to start taking Marvelon 21 or 28 days after delivery. If so, you don't need any extra contraceptive precautions. Read the section 'How to take Marvelon', above.   If you have had sex in the 21 to 28 days since the baby was born you must not start Marvelon until the first day of your first period.   If you start Marvelon more than 28 days after delivery you will not be protected against pregnancy for the first 7 days of taking pills. For these 7 days, take extra contraceptive precautions. Read the section 'Extra contraceptive precautions', carefully.   If you are breast feeding you can still become pregnant, and so you should take contraceptive precautions. Your doctor may advise you not to use the pill- it may reduce the amount of breast-milk you produce, especially if you start taking it shortly after delivery.   You might be able to use the mini-pill (POP). Ask your doctor for advice.     After a miscarriage or abortion   If you have just had a miscarriage or an abortion you should start taking Marvelon immediately. You are then fully protected against pregnancy and don't need any extra contraceptive precautions. Read the section 'How to take Marvelon'.     What to do If your periods seem different at first   This is normal when you start the pill. You will probably have less bleeding and it may be a different shade of red. You may have a little bleeding from time to time while taking the pills but this should stop within a few months. If your periods seem different, don't stop taking your pills, just mention it to your doctor at your next visit.     If bleeding occurs on any of the 21 pill-taking days   If you have been taking Marvelon correctly for a few months and you see sudden spotting or break-through bleeding (not seen in previous cycles), this may mean that the pill is not working fully as a contraceptive. You should consult your doctor.     If you forget to take a pill     If you are   less than 12 hours   late in taking a pill, you are still protected against pregnancy. Take the pill as soon as you remember, and take the next one at your normal time. This may mean taking 2 pills in one day.     If you are   more than 12 hours   late in taking one or more pills you will not be protected. As soon as you remember take the last missed pill. This may mean taking 2 pills in one day. Continue to take the pills at your normal time. You will not be protected for the next 7 days, and you must take extra contraceptive precautions, and   must follow the 7-day rule.        THE 7-DAY RULE     If:     you are more than 12 hours late in taking any pill; or     you have a stomach upset or diarrhoea for more than 12 hours; or     your doctor advises you to follow the 7-day rule because you are taking certain medicines then continue to take your pills as usual.     However take extra contraceptive precautions for the next 7 days.   Read the section 'Extra contraceptive precautions' carefully.   BUT-   If these 7 days run beyond the end of your pack  , start the next pack as soon as you have finished the present one.    Do not leave a gap between packs.    You may not have a period until the end of 2 packs but this does you no harm. Nor does it matter if you see some bleeding on pill-taking days.    If you have a stomach upset or diarrhoea   If you have vomiting or diarrhoea the pill may not work. Continue taking it, but you may not be protected from  the first day of vomiting or diarrhoea. If the symptoms disappear within 12 hours after you've taken a pill, take an extra pill from a spare pack and continue with the rest of the pack as usual Marvelon should still give you contraceptive protection during this cycle. However, if the symptoms continue after those 12 hours you must take extra contraceptive precautions during the stomach upset or diarrhoea and for the next 7 days. (Read the sections on the '7-day rule' and 'Extra contraceptive precautions carefully). If your stomach upset or diarrhoea continues for some time, consult your doctor.     If you have to take other medicines   Several medicines may interfere with the way the pill works. These include some drugs that treat acne, epilepsy and tuberculosis and some antibiotics. Other less common medicines might also have this effect.   If you are diabetic, the pill may alter the amount of insulin or other antidiabetic drugs which you need to take. You should consult your doctor for specific advice.   Always tell your doctor if you plan to use other medicines.   Remember to tell any doctor you consult that you are on this pill before they prescribe other medicines.     If you want to skip a period   Sometimes you may want to skip a period, such as during holidays, exams or other special occasions. You can do this with Marvelon but there are certain limits.   To   skip   your period entirely, don't leave a gap between packs. Start a new pack on the day after finishing your old pack. Use the pack in the normal way for 21 days. During the use of the second pack you may notice slight spotting or breakthrough bleeding but you will still have full contraceptive protection provided you have not forgotten any pills. Start your next pack of Marvelon after 7 pill-free days.     If you miss a period   If you have taken   all   your pills   correctly   you are very unlikely to be pregnant. Take your next pack as normal. If you have not taken them correctly, or if you miss a second period, see your doctor at once.    If you are having an operation. treatment for varicose veins or have to stay in bed    If you are planning to have an operation, surgery to the legs or medical treatment for varicose veins that will mean Iying in bed afterwards, it may be best for you to stop taking the pill at least four to six weeks beforehand. You will need to take extra contraceptive precautions. If you have an accident, emergency surgery or long illness that means Iying in bed for some time your doctor may advise you to stop taking the pill. You will need to take extra contraceptive precautions. You can usually start taking the pill again two weeks after you are fully mobile. Ask your doctor for advice.     What to do If you smoke   Smoking increases the risks to your health and increases some of the risks of taking the pill It is best to stop smoking anyway. Older women, who continue to smoke, may be advised to change to another contraceptive method.     If you want to have a baby   If you want to have a baby you should stop taking the pill it is not harmful to get pregnant straight after this. However, it is helpful to wait until you have had two periods before you try to get pregnant. This makes it easier to work out when the baby is due. You can use another contraceptive method such as a cap plus spermicide or a condom until then. Occasionally regular periods do take some time to return, but this is rare.     Important tips     Make sure that any doctor you consult knows that you are taking Marvelon.     Keep your Marvelon pills out of reach of children.     Keep extra Marvelon packs in a cool, dry and dark place (not in the fridge).  continued          More about Marvelon   You may find some of the medical words used difficult to understand.

If having stopped using the pill, you wish to restart.     if you wish to change your method of contraception.       Adverse reactions   Various adverse reactions have been associated with contraceptive pills that contain oestrogen or progestogen. They can be classified as   mild, more annoying or serious  . if any signs or symptoms appear that make you think that you may have a serious adverse reaction, you should stop using the pill and consult your doctor immediately.     Mild reactions   A variety of complaints have been reported in women who use the pill. However these complaints are not necessarily caused by the pill. They are not normally dangerous and are not likely to damage your health.      During the first few months  , you may experience bleeding between your periods (see More Annoying Reactions), nausea, vomiting, headaches, breast tenderness and mood swings. These symptoms usually get less or disappear after a few months. However, if bleeding is heavy or prolonged consult your doctor.     You may gain a little weight. You should control this by dieting.     Occasionally you may not have a period, especially if you use a low-dose pill.     Your blood pressure may go up a little.       More Annoying Reactions    During the first few months  During the first few    Occasionally the following conditions may occur.     worsening of fibroids or endometriosis (disorders of the womb)     chloasma (yellow brownish patches on the skin). Chloasma can be reduced by avoiding too much exposure to the sun     rash, erythema nodosum (red swellings on the legs)     discomfort of the eyes if contact lenses are used     increased need for insulin or other antidiabetics in diabetic patients     milky discharge from the breast     pain or enlargement of the breast     vaginal infections, with or without vaginal discharge.         Serious reactions   Thrombosis (formation of blood clots in the blood vessels of the legs, lungs brain, heart or elsewhere). With the pill, and especially with earlier pills which contained higher quantities of oestrogen and progestogen, the risk of blood clots occurring in veins and arteries has been reported to be slightly greater than for women who don't use the pill.     Veins   In a very small number of women, clots broke away from the calf veins, and lodged in the arteries of the lungs causing 'pulmonary embolism'.     Arteries   It was reported that older women (35 40 years of age) who continued to smoke while taking the pill were more likely to suffer heart attacks and strokes. However, it has been shown that this is almost entirely due to the smoking habits of the women involved. You should stop smoking.   You should go for regular careful blood pressure checks. if you yet high blood pressure stop using the pill.   People don't always recover fully from a thrombosis and very occasionally they are fatal. Thrombosis has hardly ever been reported to occur in veins or arteries of the liver, the gut, the kidney or the eye.   With modern low-dose pills there are reasons to believe that the events mentioned above may occur less often than with the earlier pills.    Other risk factors, apart from smoking, such as being greatly overweight, having fatty deposits in the arteries, high blood pressure diabetes, a major operation, long-term immobilisation and severe varicose veins may also increase the risk of contracting either thrombosis, heart attack or stroke.    Signs and symptoms of a blood Cot are given under the Warnings Section.   On rare occasions, using the pill may lead to liver diseases such as jaundice and gall-stones, and very rarely it has been associated with certain liver tumours.   Oestrogen-dependent tumours.   Some studies have shown an increased risk of cervical and/or breast cancer on long term use of the combined contraceptive pill, however, this evidence is not conclusive. This possible risk, though small, may be expected to be less with low dose pills.   A rare disease of the skin and blood vessels called Lupus erythematosus.   A rare disease called Sydenham's Chorea.      Beneficial effects   The following beneficial effects have been associated with oestrogen/progestogen containing oral contraceptives.     Your periods   Your periods may become shorter, more regular and may be less painful.   You may bleed less and be less likely to have iron deficiency anaemia.   You may also suffer less from pre-menstrual tension.

"      Progynova 1 mg    The leaflet for Progynova 1 mg is in the form of a small booklet The information that it contains follows.     Please read this carefully before you start your medicine  .   This booklet only provides a summary of the information available on your medicine. If you have any questions or are not sure about anything ask your doctor or pharmacist.   The reason why you can only get this medicine with a doctor's prescription is that its use needs medical supervision.   Please tell your doctor if you have any doubts or worries about taking this medicine, either before you start or while you are taking it.    What the ""change of life"" means   The ""change of life"" is a long process, normally occurring between the ages of 45 and 55 during which your reproductive organs are undergoing a slow decline. Although the change of life is natural, it often causes distressing symptoms, which are connected with the gradual loss of the hormones produced by the ovaries.    The name of your medicine is:   Progynova 1 mg (oestradiol valerate).     What does Progynova 1 mg contain?   Each tablet contains 1 mg of oestradiol valerate and the following inactive ingredients: lactose, maize starch, povidone 25 000, povidone 700 000, magnesium stearate (E572), sucrose, polyethylene glycol 6 000, calcium carbonate (E170), talc, glycerin (E422), montan glycol wax, titanium dioxide (E171), ferric oxide pigment (E172).   Each pack of Progynova 1 mg contains 3 memo packs (strips) of 28 tablets. Packs containing 1 memo strip of 28 tablets are also available to doctors.   Progynova 1 mg is a hormone replacement therapy.    The product licence is held by   Schering Health Care Ltd, The Brow, Burgess Hill, West Sussex, RH15 9NE.   Progynova 1 mg is manufactured by Schering AG, Berlin, Germany.     How Progynova 1 mg helps you through the ""change of life""   Progynova 1 mg is used for ""hormone replacement therapy"" because it contains the principal oestrogen hormone that is lost during the ""change of life"". Therefore, it replaces the oestrogen that your body can no longer make, and this prevents or improves the troublesome symptoms.     Reasons for not taking Progynova 1 mg   Before taking Progynova 1 mg tell your doctor if you have any of these: clots in the blood vessels (thrombotic disorders) or a history of these conditions severe diabetes with changes to the blood vessels abnormal red blood cells (sickle-cell anaemia); high blood fats (disorders of lipid metabolism); existing or treated hormone-dependent tumours of the breast; a history during pregnancy of (1) itching of the whole body (pruritus of pregnancy), (2) the blister-like rash (most commonly on the palms and soles) known as herpes gestationis, (3) deterioration of inherited deafness (otosclerosis) or (4) jaundice not explained by infections, poisons or obstruction of the flow of bile (idiopathic jaundice of pregnancy);certain other types of idiopathic jaundice (Dubin-Johnson or Rotor syndromes)- severe disturbances of liver function- previous or existing liver tumours; lumpy, painful breasts (mastopathy); the presence of tissue of the lining of the womb in places of the body where it is not normally found (endometriosis).     What you should know before taking Progynova 1 mg   Diseases that are known to be subject to deterioration during pregnancy might behave similarly during treatment, and require careful observation while you are taking Progynova 1 mg (e.g. the disease of the nervous system called multiple sclerosis, fits (epilepsy), diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension} lumpy or painful breasts (benign breast disease) certain types of heart or kidney disease, asthma, tetany and inherited deafness (otosclerosis) and the inherited disease called porphyria).   If you have   not   had a hysterectomy (i.e. you still have a womb), you will need to take another hormone called a progestogen, with Progynova 1 mg. Your doctor will be able to advise you further.   Your doctor will carry out gynaecological, blood pressure and other examinations as appropriate, e.g. if you are known to have any liver disease, your doctor will arrange for your liver function to be checked periodically.   Your doctor will examine your breasts periodically during treatment, particularly if there is a history of breast cancer in your family.   During or after the use of hormones such as are contained in Progynova 1 mg, benign liver tumours have rarely occurred, and even more rarely malignant liver tumours. In isolated cases, bleeding from such tumours into the abdomen has endangered life. Although such events are extremely improbable with Progynova 1 mg, you should inform your doctor about any unusual feelings in your upper abdomen that do not disappear within a short time.     Reasons for stopping Progynova 1 mg immediately   There is not known to be any increased risk of blood clotting (thrombosis) during the use of Progynova 1 mg. However, it should not be used if thrombosis is present, and as a precaution you are therefore advised to stop taking Progynova 1 mg at once and consult your doctor if you experience any of the following: the very first attack of migraine (typically a throbbing headache and nausea, preceded by visual disturbances) that you have ever experienced- worsening of pre-existing migraine- any unusually frequent or unusually severe headaches; sudden disturbances of vision or hearing; inflamed veins (phlebitis); pains in the chest or abdomen; swelling in the limbs; pain, tingling or numbness in any part of the body; unexplained cough; breathlessness; pain on breathing.   Progynova 1 mg must also be stopped at once if you develop jaundice, or if your doctor finds your blood pressure to be significantly raised or if you notice an increase in epileptic seizures.   If you have any of the symptoms listed above you should stop taking the tablets and contact your doctor at once.   Ask your doctor for advice on whether you should stop taking the tablets if you are confined to bed, or have an accident or illness, or you need an operation.    What to do if . . .      You are taking other medicines at the same time as Progynova 1 mg   Some drugs e.g. antibiotics and antiepileptics may reduce the effectiveness of Progynova 1 mg.   If you have to take any other medicines regularly, you should inform your doctor.   If you are diabetic your doctor may alter the dose of medicine required to treat your diabetes.   If in doubt about any medicines you are taking, ask your doctor.     How to take Progynova 1 mg   About the pack: The pack is designed to help you remember to take your medicine.

Testosterone implants are pellets containing 50,100 or 250 mg of testosterone and are sold in a glass ampoule.   Each implant is packed in a cardboard carton.   There are no other ingredients in the pellet.   These implants are used in hormone replacement therapy in men and women. Testosterone is a natural male hormone, known as an androgen, which controls normal sexual development in men.    The product licence is held by:   Organon Laboratories Limited, Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge, CB4 4FL.    Testosterone implants are made by:   Organon Laboratories Limited, Newhouse Industrial Estate, Newhouse, Motherwell, Scotland, ML1 5SH.     What are Testosterone Implants used for?   Testosterone implants are used in testosterone replacement therapy for male sexual problems for example:     impotence caused by hormonal disorders     after castration or a similar problem called eunuchoidism     decreased sex drive and decreased mental and physical activity     infertility caused by low sperm count     bone loss caused by low hormone levels.     Implants can also be used in women together with other forms of hormone replacement therapy to relieve symptoms such as decreased sexual drive and loss of energy.     Before your Implant is inserted Men     Do you have or think you may have cancer of the prostate or breast?       Women     Do you think you may be pregnant?     Are you breast-feeding?     If the answer to any of these questions is YES,     Did you tell your doctor at the last visit, or an earlier visit?     If NOT, then you should do so as soon as possible. Even so your doctor may still want you to have the implant.     What do you need to know before having an Implant?   Extra supervision by you doctor may be necessary in some cases particularly the elderly.   Tell your doctor if you have ever had:     heart disease     kidney disease     liver disease     high blood pressure     epilepsy     migraine     Testosterone should be used carefully in women as it can cause hoarseness of the voice.   In young boys testosterone can cause early sexual development and delay growth.      What other medicines are you taking?   Other medicines may affect how the testosterone implant works or testosterone may affect how they work.   Certain types of drugs can cause more enzymes to be made in the liver. These are called ""enzyme inducing drugs"", for example medicines used to treat epilepsy; phenobarbitone. These drugs will affect the way Testosterone works.   Tell your doctor if you are taking or intend to take any other medicines.     How a Testosterone Implant is given How much   The dose is chosen by your doctor. In men usually a dose of 100-600 mg implant is given, but this depends on each individual. In women a dose or 50-100 mg is usual, together with another form of hormone replacement therapy.     How the implant is inserted   Testosterone implants are inserted under the skin into the lower abdominal wall or buttock by your doctor. You are usually given a local anaesthetic in this area before the implant is inserted and the small cut made is dressed with a bandage afterwards.   The implant usually lasts for 4-5 months.     What to do if someone is accidentally given too much   If the dose is too much it can cause a woman's voice to deepen and cause frequent erections in men. If this occurs tell your doctor immediately. He/she may want to remove the implant.     What about side effects?   Testosterone may cause side effects in some people.   If you have any of the following side-effects tell your doctor. He may decide to stop treatment for a while.   In men it may cause:     prolonged painful erection     increased sexual desire     decreased amounts of ejaculation fluid     low sperm count     water retention     In young boys, early sexual development, erections occurring more often than normal, enlarged penis, delayed growth.   In women it may cause hoarseness of the voice and excess hair growth.   Tell your doctor if you have any side effects which are serious or troublesome and if side effects continue.

It is a powder which has been mixed with liquid, normally Water for Injection, to make a solution which is ready for use as an injection or an infusion (a ""drip"").   If Cefrom is used as an injection it contains a concentration of 1g of cefpirome, the active ingredient, in 10ml of solution.   If Cefrom is used as an infusion it contains a concentration of 1g of cefpirome, the active ingredient, in 50ml of solution.   Cefrom is available as 0.25g, 0.5g, 1g and 2g packs.   The injection solution also contains Water for Injection and anhydrous sodium carbonate.   The infusion solution contains anhydrous sodium carbonate and may also contain other ingredients depending on the liquid used in your drip prescribed by your doctor. You should ask the person giving you the drip what it contains in case you may be allergic to any of these ingredients .   Cefpirome sulphate, the active ingredient, belongs to a group of medicines called antibiotics. Antibiotics kill bacteria which cause infections in your body.     WHO HAS MADE YOUR MEDICINE ?   The marketing authorisation for Cefrom is held by Roussel Laboratories Ltd, Broadwater Park, North Orbital Road, Denham, Uxbridge, Middlesex, UB9 5HP.   It is manufactured either by Roussel Laboratories Ltd, Covingham, Swindon, Wiltshire or by Hoechst AG, 6230 Frankfurt am Main 80, Germany.     WHAT IS YOUR MEDICINE USED FOR ?   Your medicine is used to treat bacterial infections.     WILL THE MEDICINE SUIT YOU ?   Before you are given Cefrom, please read the following statements.     Have you ever suffered a severe reaction to this or any other antibiotics, particularly penicillins ?      Are you pregnant or breast feeding ?     Are you allergic to sodium carbonate ?      Are you under 12 years of age ?     If you think that any of the statements apply to you, DO NOT have the injection or drip - discuss the situation with your nurse or doctor before you are given your medicine.      PATIENT INFORMATION LEAFLET    ARE YOU TAKING ANY OTHER MEDICINES ?   Cefrom may interfere with other medicines that you may be taking; such as loop diuretics (used to increase the flow of urine) and aminoglycoside antibiotics (used to treat infections).   In some cases your doctor will arrange further monitoring for you, but this is routine and nothing to worry about.   It is important that you tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist about ALL the medicines that you are taking including those bought without a prescription.    HOW SHOULD YOU TAKE YOUR MEDICINE ?    Your medicine will always be given to you by a doctor or nurse. This is because it needs to be given either as an injection or by a drip.   Your doctor will have prescribed the dose of the medicine which is correct for you, depending on the type of infection and any other illnesses you may have. If you ask the person giving you the medicine they will tell you how much and how often you have been prescribed it by your doctor.     WHAT IF YOU TAKE TOO MUCH  ?   It is most unlikely that you will be given too much medicine by the nurse or doctor. Your doctor and nurse will be monitoring your progress, and checking the medicine that you are given. Always ask if you are not sure why you are getting a dose of medicine.     WHAT IF YOU MISS A DOSE ?   Your doctor or nurse have instructions when to give you your medicine. It is most unlikely that you will not be given the medicine as it has been prescribed. If you think that you may have missed a dose then talk to your nurse or doctor. It is important that the course of treatment your doctor has prescribed is taken. You may start to feel better but it is important not to stop taking this medicine, until the doctor advises, otherwise your condition may get worse again.     WHAT ABOUT SIDE EFFECTS ?   You may develop a skin rash or itchy skin, a fever, pain in your kidney region, tummy upsets, slight sickness or diarrhoea. If the diarrhoea gets very bad then no more Cefrom should be given to you and other medicines will be given to you to stop the diarrhoea.   If Cefrom is given as an injection some people find it slightly painful where the injection has been given and the skin may feel tingly or itchy.   Some people find that their sense of taste may be affected for a short time after taking Cefrom.   People may sometimes develop severe allergic reactions, such as breathing difficulties which will require treatment immediately. If you experience this you should call a doctor or nurse urgently.   Cefrom may sometimes affect your blood, although this is very unusual. It may cause you to feel tired or generally unwell. If you take the medicine for more than 10 days, your doctor may ask you to take a blood test, but this is just routine and nothing to worry about.   If you think you are reacting badly in any of these or any other ways to your medicine, talk to your nurse or doctor straight away.    HOW SHOULD YOU STORE YOUR MEDICINE ?    You will not be asked to store your medicine. It will be brought to your bed ready to be given to you straight away.   Vials of Cefrom must be stored below 25°C (normal room temperature).

"      Norditropin PenSet 24 IU    Somatropin (epr) 24 iu   Please read this leaflet. It contains important information about your medicine.     What is in the pack?     Dry powder for injection   The dry powder in the larger vial contains the active ingredient- biosynthetic human growth hormone [somatropin (epr)l 24 iu. Other ingredients are glycine, sodium hydrogen carbonate and mannitol.     Cartridge containing liquid   The cartridge which fits into the pen contains a clear liquid. This is the solvent. The dry powder must be dissolved in this solvent before injecting. The solvent contains a preservative - benzyl alcohol 9 mg/ml in 2 ml Water for Injections.     What is growth hormone   Human growth hormone increases growth, mainly growth of bone. In the body, growth hormone is made by a small gland (pituitary gland) just below the brain. The scientific name for human growth hormone is somatropin.   Norditropin is human growth hormone produced by genetic engineering and is not made from human or animal material. Norditropin- is similar to naturally occurring human growth hormone.    Manufactured by   Novo Nordisk A/S, DK-2880, Bagsvaerd, Denmark.    Supplied by   Novo Nordisk Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Novo Nordisk House, Broadfield Park, Brighton Road, Pease Pottage, Crawley, West Sussex RH11 9RT.     Uses Growth hormone insufficiency   Growth hormone insufficiency means that the child's body cannot make enough growth hormone. Norditropin injections help to replace the natural growth hormone in these children and so speed up growth and height gain.     Turner syndrome   Norditropin injections speed up growth and height gains in girls with Turner syndrome, but it is not yet known whether this will improve their adult height.     Chronic renal (kidney) disease   Norditropin injections speed up growth and height gain in children with kidney disease who have not reached puberty. We do not yet know whether this treatment will improve the adult height in children with this condition.     Read before starting your medicine   Do not use Norditropin if being treated for cancer or a tumour: if pregnant; or if allergic to any of the ingredients in Norditropin.     Regular check ups   It is recommended that children being treated with Norditropin see their child or growth specialist for regular check ups. In patients with kidney disease, it is very important that they receive regular checks of kidney function.     Blood sugar   Growth hormone may raise blood sugar levels- let your doctor know if anyone in your family has diabetes.     Diabetes   Growth hormone may affect diabetic control and insulin doses may need to be altered.     Pregnancy   As it is not known if growth hormone injections are safe during pregnancy, if pregnancy occurs or is suspected stop treatment immediately.      Breast feeding   Do not breast feed if being treated with Norditropin.     Interactions with other medicines   Cortisone and related medicines may reduce the growth effect of Norditropin in children. Let your doctor know about other medicines that are being taken.     How to take your medicine How much to use   Your doctor will tell you how much Norditropin to use each day. Never take more than this amount.     How to use   Your doctor or nurse will show you how to inject Norditropin under the skin (subcutaneously) using Nordiject 24. Your cartridge must only be used with Nordiject 24.   Injections should be given in the evening 6-7 times a week. It is best to give each injection in a different place from the last one.     How to prepare your growth hormone for injection   The dry powder in the vial must be mixed with the liquid in the cartridge. Your doctor or nurse will show you how to do this. As a reminder, full instructions are included in the second part of this leaflet.     How to use your Nordiject 24 Injection Device   Remember to wash your hands well with soap and water and/or disinfectant before starting. The Norditropin PenSet 24 cartridge fits into the Nordiject 24 pen device. Your doctor or nurse will show you how to use Nordiject 24. As a reminder, full instructions are included in the box with your Nordiject 24.     When to stop using Norditropin   Norditropin has to be used over many years. Do not stop the treatment until your doctor tells you to. Treatment is usually stopped once adult height is reached. In children with kidney disease, treatment should stop at transplantation.     Important information Taking too much Norditropin   If you take too much Norditropin you may disturb blood sugar levels. First blood sugar levels may fall leading to, e.g. sweating, shakiness, mood changes and/or paleness. Afterwards blood sugar levels may rise too high, leading to, e.g. thirst and frequent need to pass urine.   Too much growth hormone over a long period could result in a variety of effects, e.g. too rapid growth, thickening of skin, disproportionate growth and joint pains.     Forgetting to take your Norditropin   If you forget to take your injection do not increase the dose. Carry on with the same dose and tell your doctor at the next visit.     Side effects   If any of the side effects listed below occur you should tell your doctor as soon as possible. Also tell your doctor if you believe you might be suffering any other side effect to your treatment.   Skin reactions around the injection site are rare.   Very rarely, swelling of the extremities may occur. This is due to an excess of water in the body.   There have been a few reports of raised pressure within the brain in patients on human growth hormone. This may cause bad or frequent headaches, sight problems, nausea and/or vomiting. If any of these occur - see a doctor without delay.     Other possible problems   Thyroid Hormone levels may drop while using growth hormone. Your doctor will check these from time to time and will let you know whether you need treatment with thyroid hormones.   Development of a limp or pain in the hip or knee may indicate a problem with growth of the thigh bone and you should consult your doctor if this occurs.    Take the mixing guide supplied with your Nordiject pen. Then take the vial of Norditropin and remove the plastic top. Now fit the vial onto the end of the mixing guide as shown in the drawing above.        Hold the vial upright -   slowly   push the plunger rod down as far as it will go so that all the solvent is forced into the vial.

Your cartridge is now ready for use.     You can now also discard the plunger rod and empty Norditropin vial.   Remember to keep the mixing guide.        ",
"      Leustat™ Injection (cladribine)    Why should you read this leaflet?   Please read this leaflet carefully; it tells you about the Leustat Injection your doctor has prescribed for you. The leaflet does not contain the complete information about the medicine. If you have any questions about what is written here or wish for any further information, please ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.     What is in Leustat Injection?    Brand name:   Leustat Injection Active ingredient: cladribine 1 mg/ml    Other ingredients:   sodium chloride, phosphoric acid, dibasic sodium phosphate heptahydrate, water for injection.     What should this medicine look like?   Leustat is supplied in a clear glass vial containing 10 mls of a clear, colourless liquid for intravenous infusion .     What type of medicine is Leustat?   Leustat belongs to a group of medicines called cytotoxic drugs which are used to treat diseases caused by abnormal white blood cell growth. They work by killing the abnormal blood cells.    Product licence holder:   Janssen-Cilag Ltd Saunderton, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire HP14 4HJ.    Manufactured by:   IOLAB, PO Box 367, Road 362 Km 0.5, San German, Puerto Rico 00683, USA.     What is Leustat for?   Leustat is used to treat certain types of abnormal white blood cells, which are called hairy cells. Leustat works by killing these abnormal white blood cells.     Is Leustat safe for you?   You cannot use Leustat if:     you know you are allergic to the ingredients of Leustat     you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant     you are breastfeeding     Please tell your doctor if you are suffering, or have suffered, from any of the following:     kidney disease     liver disease     diseases of the bone marrow or any blood disorders     You may still be able to use Leustat, but you should discuss this with your doctor first.     Are you taking other medicines?   Leustat does not normally react with other medicines; but tell your doctor if you are receiving, or have recently received, other drugs for your condition.     Special warnings   Leustat should only be given under the supervision of a doctor who is experienced in the use of this type of drug.   Your disease and its treatment may affect your ability to drive. Do not drive without discussing this with your doctor first.   Remember to tell your doctor that you are receiving, or have received, Leustat if you have to visit a hospital or your family doctor for any treatment, or to visit a clinic for a blood test; Leustat may affect the results.     How should Leustat be used?    Adults and the elderly:   The normal dose is based on your body weight in kilograms and is usually 0.09 mg per kilogram per day. This dose is repeated daily for seven days without a break.    Children:   Leustat injection is not recommended for children.   Leustat is normally diluted in 100-500 ml of a 0.9 percent solution of sodium chloride and then given by infusion into a vein (intravenous infusion). Each dose is normally given by continuous infusion over a 24-hour period.   Your doctor will order regular blood tests before  and during your treatment, to check that your liver and kidneys are working properly and to follow the effects of the treatment with Leustat.   Your doctor may decide to delay or discontinue therapy if side effects develop.     Can an overdose of Leustat be given?   Too much (an overdose) of any drug should be avoided. You should inform the doctor or nurse immediately if you think you have been given too much Leustat.     What side effects can Leustat cause?   As with any other medicine, Leustat may cause unwanted side effects:   Leustat can reduce the ability of your bone marrow to produce blood cells.   If the production of red blood cells is affected, this can lead to anaemia, which may be very severe.   If the production of white blood cells is affected, this can lead to neutropenia which reduces your body's defences so that you may get an infection. This may require the use of antibiotics.   Leustat can also affect the production of platelets: these are small blood cells important for the proper clotting of blood. A fall in the number of platelets (thrombocytopenia) can lead to easier bruising and bleeding under the skin.   Leustat may affect the kidneys, leading to a decrease in their ability to get rid of waste products from the blood and a decrease in urine production.   Leustat can cause serious nerve damage, including partial or complete paralysis which may not be reversible, but usually only if given in doses higher than those normally recommended.   Other side effects may include:     fatigue     fever or chills (these may be the first signs that you have an infection; it is important that you are on the lookout for these symptoms and tell your doctor or nursing staff at once if they occur)     nausea and vomiting     skin rash     headache     decreased appetite     general debility     sweating     feeling unwell     constipation     flatulence and diarrhoea     pain in the abdomen     muscular aches and pains     numbness and tingling usually of the hands and feet     bruising     small reddish or purple spots underneath the skin called petechiae     dizziness     insomnia     anxiety     accumulation of fluid under the skin (oedema)     an increased pulse rate     a change in normal breathing and/or heart beat sounds (your doctor will be able to detect these if he listens to your chest with a special device called a stethoscope)     cough     shortness of breath     reactions at the site where the injection is given: redness, itching, swelling, pain, blood clot formation (thrombosis), inflammation of the vein (phlebitis).      Tell your doctor or nursing staff immediately if you experience any of the above effects or notice anything else unusual while you are receiving treatment with Leustat.      Additional information   When abnormal white blood cells are destroyed in large numbers they can release certain substances into the blood. This may cause the blood levels of these substances to rise, leading to kidney or heart problems. You doctor will be able to detect this from the results of regular blood tests he/she is using to monitor your treatment.       How should Leustat Injection be stored?   In hospital, vials are stored unopened in a refrigerator between 2 and 8 degrees centigrade. Vials should be protected from light.     Other important points   Do not use this product:     after the expiry date on the label     if the vial seal is broken     if a previous dose has been taken from the same vial     if the liquid is coloured or you can see particles floating in it     if it has been diluted and stored, refrigerated, for greater than 8 hours before use     if it has been diluted with 5 per cent dextrose solution Keep out of reach of children Date of revision of this leaflet: February 1996 ™ denotes trade mark       ",
"       What you should know about Humatrope   Please read this leaflet carefully before starting your child on Humatrope. It does not contain all the information that you may need to know, so please ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. This leaflet only applies to Humatrope.      What is in your Humatrope    Your medicine is called Humatrope. It is a brand of human growth hormone (also called somatropin).     Humatrope is a powder and comes in bottles of 4 International Units (1.48mg human growth hormone) or 16 International Units (5.92mg human growth hormone).    The bottles also contain mannitol, glycine and dibasic sodium phosphate.   Each bottle of Humatrope comes with a bottle of sterile Diluent (liquid) which has m-cresol and glycerol in it. Use the 2ml Diluent with the 4-unit bottle of Humatrope and the 8ml Diluent with the 16-unit size.      Human growth hormone is a protein hormone which is made in the laboratory by a 'recombinant DNA technology' process. It has the same structure as the hormone that the body produces. It is important for normal bone growth in children and teenagers.   Humatrope is made by Lilly France SA, Rue du Colonel Lilly, 67640 Fegersheim, France. The product licence is held by Lilly Industries Limited, Dextra Court, Chapel Hill, Basingstoke, Hampshire, RG21 2SY.       Why Humatrope?   Humatrope is used to treat children and teenagers who do not develop to their normal height because of poor bone growth. Growth hormone deficiency or Turner's syndrome are medical conditions which result in slow bone growth.       Before injecting Humatrope    Make sure it is safe for the patient to be injected with Humatrope.      Humatrope should not be used if:     The bones can no longer grow.     The patient has an active brain tumour or any other tumour (cancer). However, your doctor may prescribe Humatrope if the patient has had a brain tumour and needs no more treatment for it. The patient should be reexamined frequently to make sure that the tumour has not come back or started to grow.     Do not use the Diluent if the patient is extremely sensitive to m-cresol - read the section on mixing Humatrope.     A doctor trained in hormone disorders must examine the patient to decide if it is safe to use Humatrope.     Tell your doctor if the patient is pregnant or breast-feeding .     Tell your doctor if the patient is diabetic because he or she may need more or less insulin when taking Humatrope.     Tell your doctor if the patient is already taking a glucocorticoid hormone such as cortisone or prednisone. This is because the combination may reduce the response to growth hormone. The patient must be frequently re-examined.         Using Humatrope   Your doctor will tell you which Humatrope strength to use; how much to use; and where to inject it. The patient's total dose each week will depend on his or her body weight or body size (surface area).   Use Humatrope exactly as your doctor tells you to. The usual dose is:    Dose for Growth hormone deficiency   Inject up to 0.07 international units per kilogram of body weight (0.026mg per kilogram) once a day.    Or   Inject up to 0.16 international units per kilogram of body weight (0.06mg per kilogram) on 3 days each week.      Dose for Tumer's syndrome   Inject 0.8 to 0.9 international units (0.30 to 0.33mg) per kilogram of body weight each week. Divide the total weekly dose into 6 or 7 doses and inject one dose each day. Inject Humatrope under the skin.   Humatrope can be injected under the skin or into a muscle.      Please read the back of this leaflet           What you should know about Humatrope - continued         Mixing, Preparing and Injecting Humatrope   You must not mix Humatrope or Inject it until your doctor has trained you to do it correctly. Make sure that everything you use in the procedure is sterile.    Mixing Humatrope   You must only mix Humatrope with Diluent. Never mix it with anything else unless your doctor tells you to. He or she will tell you to use 'Water for Injections' if the patient is extremely sensitive to m-cresol. In this case, mix the powder with 'Water for Injections' instead of Diluent. You must get the 'Water' from your pharmacist or doctor. Do not use tap water. Make up and use one dose out of each bottle and use the dose within 24 hours. Safely dispose of the leftover mixture.   Your doctor will tell you what size of syringe and needle to use and how much Diluent to add. It will usually be 0.5 to 2.0ml with the 4-unit size or 2.0 to 8.0ml with the 16-unit size.     Always wash your hands before you start.     Take off and throw away the caps from the tops of the Diluent and Humatrope bottles.     Wipe the tops of both the bottles with an alcohol swab. Fix the needle onto the syringe. Take off and keep the needle cover. Pull back the syringe plunger to draw up an amount of air into the syringe equal to the amount of Diluent that your doctor has told you to use. Push the needle into the stopper of the Diluent bottle and inject the air into the bottle.     Hold the bottle upside down and, making sure that the tip of the needle is in the solution, draw up the amount of Diluent that your doctor has told you to. After making sure that there are no air bubbles in the syringe, turn the bottle upright and, holding the barrel, take out the syringe.     Using the same needle, slowly inject the Diluent into the bottle of Humatrope aiming the stream of liquid against the side of the bottle.   Do not aim it at the white powder at the bottom of the bottle.   Before taking the syringe out of the bottle, draw in the same amount of air as the Diluent you have injected into the bottle. This is to equalise the pressure in the bottle. If the needle is the type that can be taken out of the barrel of the syringe, take it out and dispose of the needle safely. If the needle and syringe are one complete unit, safely dispose of the whole unit.     Swirl the bottle gently to completely dissolve the contents.   Do not shake the bottle.      Label the bottle with the date you mixed it and throw away any leftover Diluent.      Preparing the injection      Do not inject the mixture if it is cloudy or has any particles in it.     If the needle can be changed in the syringe that you are using, always use a new needle for each injection. If the syringe and needle are a complete unit, always use a new unit for every injection.     Before and after every injection, wipe the rubber stopper of the bottle with rubbing alcohol or an alcoholic antiseptic solution to keep it clean and safe.     When you are ready to inject, take off the needle cover and draw the same amount of air into the syringe as your measured dose of Humatrope.     Push the needle into the bottle of mixed Humatrope and inject the air into the bottle. Turn the bottle upside down and, making sure the tip of the needle is in the solution, draw out your correct dose. Make sure that there are no air bubbles in the syringe.     Remove the syringe and put back the needle cover.     Keep the rest of the Humatrope in the fridge. You must use it within 14 days. Dispose of any leftover after this time.        Injecting Humatrope      Use the method and needles your doctor has told you to use and follow this general advice:     Gently tap the skin where you are going to inject several times with your fingers.     Wipe the skin thoroughly with an alcohol swab. Use a circular motion and work outward from the inside of the circle.      Injections beneath the skin (subcutaneous):   With your thumb and forefinger, pinch up a large area of skin. Do not inject into exactly the same place each time.     Holding the syringe at a 90-degree angle with the needle aimed at the injection site, quickly put the needle all the way into the pinched area of skin.     Slowly inject the mixture.     Quickly take the needle out of the skin and firmly press a dry gauze pad or cotton ball onto the injection site. Rub the injection site with the pad for several seconds.     Safely dispose of the needle, or the needle and syringe, after every injection.      Injection into muscle (intramuscular):   With your thumb and first 2 fingers, press the skin down firmly against a large muscle mass, such as the thigh.     Holding the syringe at a 90-degree angle with the needle aimed at the injection site, quickly put the needle all the way into the skin.     When the needle is in place, slowly pull back on the plunger. If blood comes into the syringe, take out the needle; safely dispose of the syringe and drug, and start all over again.   If no blood comes into the syringe, slowly inject the mixture into the muscle.     Take the needle out quickly, and firmly press a dry gauze pad or cotton ball onto the injection site. Rub the injection site with the pad for several seconds.     Safely dispose of the needle, or the needle and syringe, after every injection.      If you have any questions, please ask  your doctor.        While using Humatrope     If the patient becomes pregnant, stop the injections and tell your doctor.     Humatrope can affect the amount of thyroid hormone in the blood, so patients must have thyroid function tests from time to time. If the thyroid is not working properly, Humatrope may not work as well as it should.     Any child who begins to limp must be examined by a doctor.     Humatrope sometimes causes side effects. If there is any pain or redness at the injection site, or if there is any swelling, tell your doctor.     Tell your doctor if the patient looks unusually pale or bruises more easily than usual.         How to store Humatrope   Do not use Humatrope after the 'Use Before' date.   Both before and after mixing, keep your Humatrope and Diluent in a fridge, between 2° and 8°C. Do not freeze the Diluent or the mixed bottle. Humatrope can be used for up to 14 days after mixing if you keep it in these conditions.   Do not keep the mixed Humatrope in plastic syringes.   REMEMBER: This medicine is for a child. Never give it to anyone else. It may harm them, even if their symptoms are the same.   ‘Humatrope' is a registered trademark of Eli Lilly and Company (USA).

IT IS IMPORTANT TO READ THIS CAREFULLY BEFORE STARTING TREATMENT   Following this advice gives the application a chance to work safely and effectively.    What is in your scalp application   Betnovate Scalp Application is one of a group of medicines called topical steroids. ""Topical"" means they are put on the skin.

IF you find your condition gets worse during treatment you may be allergic to it or have a scalp infection.    STOP USING THE SCALP APPLICATION AND TELL YOUR DOCTOR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE   Repeated courses of topical steroids over a long time may sometimes cause changes in hair growth and skin colour.    Where to keep your scalp application   As with all medicines keep this scalp application safely away from children.      Keep it away from fire as it is inflammable    Guidance on how to use the scalp application   If your doctor has told you in detail how to use the scalp application then keep to that advice otherwise:–     Morning and evening:–     Unscrew the cap on the bottle and place the nozzle on the part of the scalp that needs treating.     Gently squeeze the bottle until the area to be treated is completely covered with a thin layer of liquid. You can gently rub it into the scalp if you wish.     Your scalp will feel cool until the liquid has dried off. The active ingredient is then left on your scalp.     As soon as the scalp problem looks better use once a day or less.        For a child:   It should not be used in children under one year of age.   Never use more than is needed to cover the scalp condition.   Do not use for a long time (nearly every day for weeks or months).   Do not cover with an airtight dressing.      What to do with any unused scalp application   If your doctor stops your treatment return what is left to a pharmacist. Only keep it if your doctor tells you to.

"      Patient Information Leaflet    Intron A Injection     What is Intron A   Intron A contains a substance known as alfa interferon. Alfa interferons are proteins which are normally produced by the body to help defend itself against viruses. As well as anti-viral properties, alfa interferons can slow down the development of some types of cancer cells.     What type of medicine is it?   Intron A is an alfa interferon used to treat some viral infections and certain types of cancer. It cannot be taken by mouth since it would be broken down by enzymes in the gut. It must therefore be administered by injection. The dose is measured in International Units (IU).     What do vials of Intron A contain?   Powder vials contain either 3, 5 or 10 million IU of interferon alfa-2b(rbe).They also contain the following inactive ingredients: glycine, sodium phosphate dibasic, sodium phosphate monobasic and human albumin.   Product Licence Holder: Schering-Plough Ltd, Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire AL7 1TW.   Manufactured by: Schering-Plough (Briny) Co., Innishannon, County Cork, Ireland.     When is Intron A used?   Intron A is used to treat a n umber of different cancers and viral infections. These are:   Hairy Cell Leukaemia: a very rare type of cancer of the blood Chronic myelogenous leukaemia: a cancer of the blood Multiple myeloma: a cancer of the bone marrow Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma: a cancer of the lymph glands   AlDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma: a rare skin tumour which can develop in patients with AIDS.   Hepatitis B: a viral infection of the liver Chronic Hepatitis C/Non-A, Non-B: a viral infection of the liver Condylomata acuminata: genital warts caused by a viral infection   Your doctor will explain to you which of these conditions you have.     Are there any people who should not be treated with Intron A?   You should not be treated if you:     are allergic to any of the ingredients in Intron A     have a severe heart complaint     have severe kidney disease     have epilepsy, or other nervous system problems     have thyroid disease (unless you are taking treatment for it)     Children are not normally treated with Intron A unless the doctor thinks that it is essential.   You should not take Intron A if you have certain types of long-term liver disease e.g. cirrhosis (check with your doctor if you are not sure).     It may be necessary to carry out tests during treatment   At intervals whilst receiving Intron A therapy and prior to starting treatment your blood will be tested. In addition, if you are being treated for Hepatitis B you may also need a special liver test (a liver biopsy).     Are there any other reasons why Intron A should not be used?   If you are pregnant or breast-feeding a baby you should only be treated with Intron A if you have discussed with your doctor whether the benefits of the medicine for you, the mother, outweigh any possible risks to the child. If you are of child-bearing age, you should use contraceptives during treatment.      What would happen if you were allergic to Intron A?   Very rarely, some patients have allergic reactions following their first injection. This could be in the form of a severe, red or itchy rash, difficulty in breathing, or shock. Your doctor will then stop your treatment.     Should Intron A be stopped for any other reason?   If you have any of the following illnesses before treatment, or develop them whilst on treatment, you r doctor may need to reduce your dose of Intron A, or you may need extra treatment to control them. Your doctor will decide by watching the signs and symptoms carefully, doing tests if necessary. In some cases it may be necessary to stop Intron A altogether.     chest problems or pneumonia     diabetes     problems with blood clotting     liver conditions     low blood pressure     a heart attack or irregular heart beat     depression, confusion, unconsciousness     thyroid problems     psoriasis     If you notice any changes in your eyesight whilst you are taking Intron A, you should tell your doctor as he may wish to perform an eye examination.     Are there any medicines which should not be given at the same time as Intron A?   Sleeping tablets, medicines taken for anxiety (sedatives) and strong pain killers should not be taken during treatment unless you have checked with your doctor first. You can take 1-2 paracetamol 500 mg tablets, 30 minutes before injection if you need to, but remember not to exceed 8 tablets in any 24 hours.   Certain asthma drugs, called theophylline or aminophylline, may need a change in dosage during Intron A treatment     What is the dose?   The dose you are given depends on how big you are. It varies with your body surface area. Technically, this is measured in square metres (m2), but actually it is worked out from your weight and height.   There are also different doses according to the disease being treated. Sometimes doctors prescribe different doses to those shown below. For example, your doctor may prescribe you a different dose of Intron A if you are already taking another medicine to treat your disease. If this applies to you, you can discuss it with your doctor, if you have not already done so.     How is Intron A given?   Usually by subcutaneous injection. This means Intron A is injected with a short needle into the fatty tissue just under the skin. It is given either daily or three times a week on every other day, for example, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. For genital warts, the injection is made directly into the base of the wart. A local anaesthetic may be administered if it is uncomfortable.   Disease treatedDose Hairy Cell Leukaemia:2 million lU/m2 3 times a week for 6 months or more by subcutaneous injection Chronic4 to 5 million IU/m2 daily until myelogenousthe disease is under control leukaemia:then 3 times a week by subcutaneous injection Multiple myeloma3 million IU/m2 3 times a week maintenance therapy:by subcutaneous injection Non-Hodgkin's5 million IU 3 times a week for Lymphoma:18 months by subcutaneous injection AlDS-relatedUsually 30 million IU/m2 3 to 5 Kaposi's sarcoma:times a week by subcutaneous injection or by injection into the muscle      Disease treatedDose   Hepatitis B:Usually 2.5 to 5 million lU/m2 3 times a week for 4 to 6 months by subcutaneous injection.   Chronic Hepatitis C/Usually 3 million IU 3 times a Non-A, Non-B:week for up to 18 months, by subcutaneous injection.   Condylomata acuminata:1 million IU injected into the base of each wart 3 times a week for 3 weeks. As many as 5 warts can be treated at one time. The total dose each week should not be more than 15 million IU. If you have more than 5 warts, a further course of treatment may be needed.     What to do in case of overdose   Contact your doctor as soon as possible.    Many patients give injections themselves at home   As Intron A is usually given daily or 3 times a week, it is usually more convenient to have injections at home.   You can give subcutaneous injections yourself. These injections are simple to do and you will be shown how to do them. Sometimes a relative, friend or community nurse could do them for you.     Preparing for an Injection     Wash hands.     On a clean dry surface collate items required for injection:       syringe     transfer needle (green)     injection needle (grey)       1 ampoule of sterile water     Correct dose vial of Intron A (this should be stored in the refrigerator at 2-8 C)       Preparing an injection     Remove syringe and transfer needle from packaging, attach needle to syringe (taking care not to touch the end of the syringe or inside hub of needle). Leave needle guard in place and place on one side.     Flip plastic top from top of Intron A vial.     Clean the rubber top of vial with alcohol swab.     Snap off the top of water vial - protect hands by wrapping ampoule in the alcohol swab wrapper.     Remove the needle guard, check the syringe plunger moves easily. Draw up 1 ml of water.     Gently inject the sterile water through the rubber bung directing it down the side of the vial to avoid making bubbles.     Remove syringe and needle.     Make sure the powder dissolves in the water by gently shaking the vial from side to side. Allow any bubbles to settle. The solution should be colourless to pale yellow. Do not use if there are particles present in the solution.     Turn the vial upside down and insert the transfer needle through the rubber bung. Keeping the needle tip in the solution, draw back the syringe plunger until all the liquid is in the syringe. Withdraw needle from vial, replace the guard.     Hold the syringe with the needle pointing upwards and gently tap any air bubbles to the top. Expel the air by pushing the plunger of the syringe making sure you don't squirt out any of the solution.     Remove transfer needle and attach grey needle, with needle guard still in place.       Giving the subcutaneous injection     Wash hands and ensure that the place you are going to inject is clean and dry.     Hold syringe like a pencil and remove needle guard.     Pinch the skin firmly where you are going to inject. This traps some of the fatty area beneath it. Before injecting, wipe the designated area with an alcohol swab.     With the syringe straight up or at a slight angle  push it firmly and quickly into the pinched skin. Draw back the plunger to check that no blood appears. If blood comes up into the syringe, remove needle and press cotton wool firmly over the injection site to stop any bleeding. When ready start again at 3.     Gently push the plunger to inject the Intron A.     Pull the needle straight out, pressing on the area gently, but firmly, with cotton wool/gauze swab to arrest any bleeding which may occur.     Dispose of syringe, needles and glass waste immediately into ""sharps"" bin, which may be obtained by sending the enclosed reply-paid card.       What to do if you forget to inject Intron A   Inject your recommended dose as soon as you remember and then carry on as normal.     Are there any side-effects   Like all drugs, Intron A has side effects. Although a lot of different side effects have been seen, you should remember that most of them only rarely occur. Side effects are generally dose related and get better when treatment is stopped.   The most common side effects are ""flu-like"" symptoms, such as fever, fatigue and headache. These symptoms are similar to those experienced when you catch flu and the body produces interferon naturally to fight off the virus. The feverish symptoms are most likely to occur 2 to 6 hours after the first few injections. After 2 weeks or so they are likely to disappear. Injecting Intron A about 2 hours before bedtime and taking 1-2 paracetamol 500 mg tablets 30 minutes before the injection and again when you go to bed will help alleviate the symptoms. Remember not to take more than 8 tablets in any 24 hour period.   You may go on feeling tired after the first few weeks of Intron A therapy. If this is the case, take plenty of rest and pace your activities. You may also suffer from nausea and lose your appetite.   You may occasionally suffer from some less common side-effects, such as: vomiting, diarrhoea, joint pain and weakness, sleepiness, dizziness, dry mouth, hair loss, back pain, depression, increased sweating, taste alteration, irritability, difficulty sleeping, confusion, difficulty in concentrating and low blood pressure.   The following side-effects only occur rarely in a few patients being treated with Intron A: abdominal pain, rash, nervousness, problems at the site of injection e.g. inflammation or redness, Herpes simplex e.g. cold sores, itching, eye pain, anxiety, nose bleeds, coughing, sore throat, chest problems, pneumonia, inflammation of the lungs, drowsiness, loss of weight, swelling of the face, difficulty breathing, indigestion, irregular heart beat, high blood pressure, increased appetite, decreased sex drive, bleeding of the gums, problems with your eyesight. Intron A may also have an effect on the thyroid gland and cause high blood sugar. If you are having laboratory tests performed on your blood and urine, Intron A may cause abnormal results. Very rarely, a few people have had fits after having high doses of Intron A.   If you think you are suffering from these, or any other side effects, you should tell your doctor.    How you should store your Intron A   Intron A powder should be stored in a refrigerator at   2-8°C but can be stored at room temperature (below ! 25°C) for short periods e.g. when travelling long distances, but solutions which have been made up from the powder should be stored at 2-8 C in a refrigerator. You may keep the solution for 24 hours when you store it in a refrigerator. Do not use the solution after this time.   Do not use Intron A after the expiry date which is stamped on the label.    If there is anything you do not understand:    You will see from this leaflet that Intron A is quite a complex medicine. If there is anything you do not understand, ask your doctor to explain it.

AFTER USING YOUR CREAM   This cream has been prescribed to millions of people by doctors, and is normally well tolerated. However, some people may get the following:     A mild burning or stinging may sometimes occur directly after application, but this will quickly go away.     Occasionally, redness, itching or a mild drying or flaking of the skin may occur. This does not prevent the cream from working.

Date of last revision of leaflet: May 1995 Zovirax is a Trade mark of The Wellcome Foundation Ltd        MORE ABOUT COLD SORES   A cold sore is an infection which is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) which is Iying dormant in nerve cells supplying your lips and the surrounding skin.     When does the infection occur?   The first infection usually occurs in early childhood, probably after being kissed by a person with a cold sore. The virus passes through the skin travels up a nerve and stays in a nerve junction until reactivated.     What can reactivate the virus?   Various things, including colds, flu, menstruation, fatigue, emotional upset, stress, physical injury, bright sunlight and simply when you are feeling run down . Once reactivated, the virus travels back down the nerve to the skin on and around your lips where it causes the cold sore to develop.      Remember - Cold Sores are infectious   The virus is capable of infecting other parts of the body. To reduce the risk of passing the infection on, do not allow others to touch your cold sore, or to share your towel, etc. You should avoid kissing and oral sex if you or your partner has an active cold sore. Always wash your hands before and after touching cold sores.       Avoid touching your eyes. HSV infection of the eye     Avoid breaking the blisters and picking the scabs can lead to ulcers on the window of the eye. Not only could you infect your cold sore with other (cornea) germs, you may infect your fingers with the virus.     Avoid kissing - especially children - when you have a cold sore     Avoid sharing your eating and drinking utensils.

Preservex is one of a group of medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs.  Specifically, Preservex is from the class of NSAIDs derived from phenylacetic acid.  The active ingredient in Preservex is aceclofenac.  Preservex works by blocking chemicals called prostaglandins.  Prostaglandins are released at the site of an injury and are responsible for producing pain and inflammation following tissue damage and immune reactions.  By preventing the synthesis of these chemicals Preservex reduces inflammation and pain associated with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.   Each tablet contains 100 mg of the active ingredient aceclofenac, and a number of inactive ingredients used to bind and coat the tablet (these are microcrystalline cellulose, sodium croscarmellose, polyvidone, glyceryl palmitostearate, and the film coat, containing partially substituted hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, polyoxyethylene 40 stearate and titanium dioxide).

Product Licence Holder and Manufacturer's Name and Address    Abbott Laboratories Ltd., Queenborough, Kent, ME11 5EL      What is Erythroped A used for?   Erythroped A is used to prevent and treat infections such as:     Ear, throat and sinus infections     Chest infections such as bronchitis and pneumonia     Skin and tissue infections such as acne     Bone infections     Sexually transmitted diseases     Mouth and dental infections     Eye infections     Stomach infections       Before taking Erythroped A   Do not take Erythroped A if you have been told that you are allergic to erythromycin or other macrolide antibiotics such as clarithromycin or azithromycin.   Do not take ergotamine tablets or use ergotamine inhalers for migraine while taking Erythroped A tablets or sachets as this can cause serious side effects.   Do not take terfenadine or astemizole tablets for hay fever or allergies whilst you are taking Erythroped A as these drugs can interact. Consult your doctor or pharmacist who can advise you on other allergy products which you can take instead.   If you have any liver problems or have been told that any drugs you are taking can cause liver problems, tell your doctor before taking Erythroped A.   Erythroped A has not been shown to be harmful during pregnancy but can pass into breast milk, so ask your doctor's advice before breast-feeding while taking Erythroped A.   Tell your doctor if you are taking any other medicine: particularly any of the following drugs: digoxin (heart drug), warfarin (blood thinner), carbamazepine and phenytoin (drugs for epilepsy), theophylline (helps breathing), cyclosporin (used following organ transplants), ergotamine or dihydroergotamine (used for severe migraine), bromocriptine (used to suppress breast milk production), disopyramide (a heart drug), triazolam (a sleeping tablet), or alfentanil (pain killer used in hospitals). The doctor may need to change your dosage.     Taking Erythroped A   The usual dose of Erythroped A sachets or tablets for adults and children over 8 years is 2 g daily in divided doses i.e. a 1 g sachet twice a day or two 500 mg tablets twice a day.  If you have a bad infection you may be told to take up to 4 g daily.  The contents of the sachet should be dissolved in a small glass of water before swallowing.    Erythroped A is normally given for 5-14 days. However, the treatment may need to be longer in certain cases. To prevent infections prior to dental work or surgical procedures, treatment is usually given one and a half to two hours before the treatment and continued every 6 hours for eight doses.    If you are not sure about the dose you should be taking or if your dose is different to that recommended in this leaflet, speak to your doctor if you have not already done so.   Take the sachets or tablets until your doctor tells you to stop; do not stop taking Erythroped A just because you feel better. If you stop the treatment too early your problem could come back.   If you forget to take a sachet or tablet, take as soon as you remember.  Do not take more sachets or tablets in one day than your doctor tells you to.   If you accidentally take more sachets or tablets in one day than your doctor has told you to, or if a child has taken some of the sachets or tablets, seek medical advice urgently.  An overdose could cause temporary hearing loss, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.     What problems can Erythroped A cause?   Erythroped A can sometimes cause stomach problems such as feeling sick, vomiting, stomach pain or diarrhoea.  It can sometimes cause allergic reactions such as rashes which are usually mild, but very rarely allergic reactions can cause difficulty in breathing, fainting and swelling of the face and throat which may need emergency treatment.   Erythroped A can rarely cause jaundice, so if you feel unwell and develop yellow skin and/or eyes, see your doctor immediately.   Reversible loss of hearing can occur rarely with high doses.   There are no reports of Erythroped A causing problems with growing teeth and only rare reports of damage to the blood, kidneys, liver or nervous system.   Changes in normal heartbeat causing dizziness, palpitations and fainting have been reported rarely in patients taking Erythroped A. Chest pain has also been reported very rarely.   Tell your doctor if you develop any of these problems or if you have any other unexpected or unusual symptoms while taking Erythroped A.     How should Erythroped A tablets and sachets be stored?

"      Scopoderm TTS  Ciba     What you need to know about Scopoderm TTS   Please read this carefully before you start to use your patches.  This leaflet does not contain the complete information about your patches.  If you have any questions or are not sure about anything ask your doctor or pharmacist.   Scopoderm TTS patches contain a substance called hyoscine.  This belongs to the group of medicines called anti-emetics (anti-sickness medicines) which are used to prevent the symptoms of motion sickness.     Things to remember about Scopoderm TTS     Make sure it is safe for you to use these patches   (see the back of this leaflet).      Instructions for using these patches are on the back of this leaflet.  Please follow them carefully.  You will need to put on a patch 5 or 6 hours before leaving on a journey.     Always wash your hands after putting on or taking off a patch.  When you take a patch off, wash the skin where it has been.  These precautions are important because if you touch your eyes with hyoscine on your fingers you may get a temporary slight blurring of vision.     These patches may cause unwanted effects in some people.  You can find information about them on the back of this leaflet.     You must not drive a car, pilot an aeroplane, work machinery or scuba dive whilst wearing these patches.     Keep your patches in a cool place, out of reach of children.  Do not refrigerate.  When you take off a patch, throw it away carefully and out of reach of children as it will still contain some active medication.  Scopoderm TTS is not suitable for children less than 10 years old.     This leaflet has been prepared for patients as part of our   'Partners in Healthcare'   theme by:    Ciba Laboratories Horsham, West Sussex, England.PL 0001/0099   MADE IN THE U.S.A.   Scopoderm TTS is a round, pink-coloured patch containing 1.5mg of hyoscine. It is used to prevent the symptoms of motion sickness.      Before using your patches     Have you ever had glaucoma (increased pressure in the eye) or suffered from pain in the eyes, blurred vision or haloes around lights?     Have you ever had an unusual or allergic reaction to hyoscine or other anti-sickness medicines?     If the answer to either of these questions is YES, DO NOT USE the patches without talking to your doctor again.     Do you suffer from any serious gastrointestinal, kidney, liver or bladder disease?     Do you suffer from epilepsy?     Are you taking any other medicines which your doctor does not know about?     Are you pregnant or breast-feeding?     If the answer to any of these questions is YES, tell your doctor or pharmacist.     Using the patches    Figure 1  Figure 2           Always use your patches as instructed by your doctor.     You will need to put on a patch 5 to 6 hours before leaving on a journey.     First remove the patch from the sachet.  Peel off the clear, hexagonal plastic backing, holding the patch by its edge so as not to touch the sticky side (Figure 1)     Press silver-coloured sticky side of the patch firmly on to a dry, hairless area of skin behind the ear and hold it there while you count slowly up to 10 (Figure 2).     Now wash your hands thoroughly.     Do not touch the patch once it is in place as you may get hyoscine on your fingers.     When your journey is over, take the patch off and throw it away carefully.  Each patch will last for up to 3 days.  If you are travelling for more than 3 days, take the patch off after 3 days and put a new one behind the other ear.     When you take a patch off, wash your hands and also the area of skin where the patch has been     Provided that you have applied the patch properly, you can swim, bathe or shower with little risk of it coming off. However, it is best not to stay in the water too long.     If the patch accidentally comes off, throw it away and put a new patch behind the other ear.       While using the patches   These patches sometimes cause unwanted effects in some people.  You may get a dry mouth but this is usually mild and wears off. Other effects which may occur are:     Sleepiness, dizziness, confusion and hallucinations.     Blurred vision.     Redness or itching of the skin where a patch has been.     If any of these effects are severe, or if any other unexpected effects occur, take the patch off. Wash the area of skin where the patch has been and tell your doctor.   Rarely unwanted effects can last for 24 hours or longer after taking off the patch.  Do not drive or work machinery until these effects wear off.     Precautions     Do not drink alcohol or take other anti-sickness medicines whilst using Scopoderm      Remember: This medicine is for you. Only a doctor can prescribe it for you.   Never give it to others. It may harm them even if they have the same symptoms as you.

"    Climaval    The patient information leaflet for Climaval is in the form of a small booklet. The text below is the information that it contains.     What you should know about CLIMAVAL tablets   This leaflet contains information on your medication. You should read it before you start to take the tablets. This information given is not designed to replace your doctor's instructions, but to reinforce them.   If you are unsure about anything or have any questions, please ask your doctor or pharmacist.     What is in your tablets?   CLIMAVAL tablets contain the active ingredient oestradiol valerate USP, which is a natural oestrogen made from plant sources. It is available in two strengths, CLIMAVAL 1 mg tablets and CLIMAVAL 2mg tablets.   The tablets contain the following inactive ingredients: lactose, maize starch, povidone, talc (sterilised), magnesium stearate, methylhydroxypropylcellulose, propylene glycol.   The colouring in the tablets contains E132, E171 and E464.   CLIMAVAL 1 mg packs contain: 28 grey-blue tablets each containing 1 mg oestradiol valerate which are marked E1 on one side.   CLIMAVAL 2 mg packs contain: 28 blue tablets each containing 2 mg oestradiol valerate which are marked E2 on one side.   Both strengths are available as one or three month calendar packs, with each calendar pack containing 28 tablets.     How does CLIMAVAL work?   CLIMAVAL tablets contain the hormone oestradiol valerate. The hormone is designed to replace the oestrogen which is lost during the decline in the function of the ovaries after the menopause. Tablets of this kind are often known as Hormone Replacement Therapy or HRT.     Who makes CLIMAVAL?   The licence for CLIMAVAL is held by Sandoz Pharmaceuticals (UK) Ltd. Frimley Business Park, Frimley, Camberley, Surrey, GU16 5SG.   CLIMAVAL tablets are made in the United Kingdom by: Medevale Pharmaservices Ltd. Ashton-Under-Lyne, England.     What is CLIMAVAL for?   CLIMAVAL is designed for use by women who have had a hysterectomy. It will relieve the symptoms associated with the menopause, by replacing the hormones lost during the decline in the function of the ovaries.   In middle age, typically between the ages of 45 and 55, a natural process occurs in women, during which the levels of female hormones found in the body decline. These hormones are produced by the ovaries and at the end of this process, which is often called the 'change of life', climacteric or menopause, the ovaries cease to function.   After a hysterectomy, even when the ovaries are left behind, women usually experience a loss of the function of ovaries earlier than they would normally. Again, this can result in symptoms of the menopause being experienced.   In some women, the drop in hormone levels causes certain symptoms, the best known of which are hot flushes, sweating, tiredness, sleeplessness and depression. Other symptoms include dizziness, headache, palpitations (flutterings in the chest), tingling in the hands and feet, and discomfort during sexual intercourse.   Few women will have all of these symptoms and the number, frequency, severity and duration of them varies from one woman to another.     Before taking your tablets   You should read this section carefully because there are some conditions your doctor should know about before you start your treatment. Ask yourself the following questions before you start taking CLIMAVAL. If you have ever suffered or currently suffer from:   Liver problems, for example jaundice, heart or kidney disease, clotting in blood vessels (the medical term for this is thromboembolism) e.g. in the legs or lungs, heart attack or stroke, persistent irregular bleeding from the vagina, any condition affected by hormones e.g. tumours of the breast or womb   Remember, tell your doctor or pharmacist, if the answer is 'yes' to any of these questions.   You should not take CLIMAVAL if you are pregnant or if you think you are pregnant and you should not breast feed while taking it.   If you are unsure about anything, ask for advice from your doctor or pharmacist.     Are you taking any other medicines?   The hormone in CLIMAVAL is to supplement your own natural hormones and it is unlikely to react with other medicines. However, you should always tell your doctor about any other medicines you are taking, including ones you have bought yourself.     Accidents, illnesses and operations   CLIMAVAL can affect your circulation and therefore your doctor may stop your CLIMAVAL tablets if you are about to have an operation or if you suffer an injury or illness where there may be an increased risk of blood clotting or if your blood pressure rises significantly for the first time.     Check ups whilst taking CLIMAVAL   While you are taking CLIMAVAL you should see your doctor regularly, at least every 6 to 12 months. You should have a thorough internal (vaginal) and physical examination before and at regular times during your treatment.   If you have mild chronic liver disease, your liver function will be checked every 8-12 weeks. Your doctor will also keep a closer eye on you if you suffer from gallstones or some diseases, including multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, migraine, diabetes, high blood pressure, hearing impairment due to bone deposits in the ear, tetany, uterine fibroids, and porphyria.   You will also be monitored and receive regular checks from your doctor if you have any significant kidney or heart impairment.   If a member of your family has had or is suffering from breast cancer you should tell your doctor because he or she may want to keep a careful check on you.   It is generally recommended that all women regularly check their breasts - if you do not know how to do this, ask your doctor or practice nurse.     How do you take CLIMAVAL?   Whether you are taking CLIMAVAL 1 mg or CLIMAVAL 2 mg tablets, you should take one tablet each day.   The pack has been designed specifically to help you take the tablets correctly.   You should take one tablet each day by following the sequence of numbers and arrows below each tablet.   Remove the tablets from the foil as shown in the picture.    Swallow your tablets whole with a glass of water. The tablets are best taken at the same time every day, try to get into a routine. You should start your next pack of CLIMAVAL IMMEDIATELY after you have finished this one. Do not take a break between packs.   You should follow your doctor's instructions as to how and when you should take CLIMAVAL tablets    Other effects of taking CLIMAVAL can be: dyspepsia or indigestion, wind, vomiting, abdominal or stomach pain, bloating, weight gain, palpitations (fluttering in the chest), increased libido, dizziness, vertigo, nose     ",

"    L1367F    Patient Information Leaflet     ECOSTATIN PESSARIES     Econazole Nitrate   Your doctor has prescribed Ecostatin Pessaries for you. Please read this leaflet before you take your medicine. It gives a summary of information about your medicine. If you want to know more, or are not sure about anything, ask your doctor or pharmacist.     WHAT IS IN ECOSTATIN PESSARIES?   The active ingredient in Ecostatin Pessaries is econazole nitrate which is an antifungal antibiotic. Each pessary contains 150 mg econazole nitrate in a base consisting of hard vegetable fat. The treatment pack contains three pessaries.      PRODUCT LICENCE HOLDER:     E.R. Squibb & Sons Limited   Hounslow, Middlesex.       PL Number:    0034/0233        Manufacturer:   Cilag Ltd.   Schaffhausen,    Switzerland.     Q.What is this medicine for?   A.Ecostatin Pessaries are for the treatment of vaginal thrush (vulvovaginal candidosis). Vaginal thrush is a common infection and is caused by a yeast (fungus) called Candida infecting the vulva and vagina. This medicine works by killing the fungus that has caused your symptoms such as any itching, soreness, redness, pain or white, non-smelly discharge.     BEFORE TAKING YOUR MEDICINE:     Q.Should I be Using Ecostatin Pessaries?   A.DO NOT use Ecostatin Pessaries if you know you are allergic to any of the ingredients.     Q.What if I am pregnant?   A.DO NOT use Ecostatin Pessaries during the first three months of pregnancy unless your doctor decides it is necessary for you. If Ecostatin Pessaries are prescribed for you later on in pregnancy check with your doctor before using the applicator. It may be better if you use your fingers to insert the pessary.     USING YOUR MEDICINE:     Q.How should I use Ecostatin Pessaries?   A.A pessary should be inserted at bedtime for three nights running. This should be continued for the three nights even if all signs of the thrush disappear beforehand. Wash and dry your hands thoroughly before handling the pessary and applicator and then follow the Instructions For Inserting The Pessary given on the page opposite.     Q.Do I continue the treatment It I have my period?   A.Yes. Do not interrupt the course of treatment. Continue until the prescribed course of pessaries is finished.     Q.Should I continue to have sex?   A.It is not a good idea to have sex while you have a thrush infection as it is easily transmitted to your sexual partner who might in turn give it back to you. Also, Ecostatin can damage the rubber of contraceptive diaphragms and condoms (sheaths) so that they are no longer safe to use.     Q.What it I miss a dose?   A.If you miss the dose insert a pessary as soon as you do remember.     INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSERTING THE PESSARY        LOADING THE APPLICATOR     Pull the plunger out about one inch.     Remove pessary from plastic wrapping.     Place the pessary into the cup end of the applicator.     Insert one pessary high into the vagina.       INSERTING THE APPLICATOR             Lie down on your back with your knees bent.     Insert the open end of the applicator into the vagina as far as it will comfortably go.     Hold the outer part of applicator in position and press plunger slowly with forefinger until the pessary is pushed out from the applicator into the vagina.     Withdraw the applicator from the vagina.       CLEANING THE APPLICATOR             Remove the plunger from the barrel by pulling it right out.     Wash both sections thoroughly under a stream of water allowing water to run through the barrel.     It is not necessary to sterilise the applicator. Do not use extremely hot water because it may soften the plastic     Dry the applicator and store in a clean place.          AVOIDING RE-INFECTION:     After passing water the toilet tissue should be used as a blotter rather than with a forward and backward motion. After bowel movement, the toilet tissue should be wiped in the direction away from the vagina in order to avoid the possibility of spreading infection from the back passage to the vagina.     Towels and underwear should be changed daily.     Your sexual partner should be treated at the same time as you using Ecostatin cream applied twice daily to the external genital area during the treatment period.       UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS:     Q.Are there any unwanted effects from Ecostatin?   A.Occasionally side effects similar to the symptoms of thrush occur (i.e. burning or irritation); this does not usually last long and disappears as the treatment is continued. If your symptoms get worse check with your doctor.     LOOKING AFTER YOUR MEDICINE:   You will see a ‘Use before’ date on the outer packaging of Ecostatin Twin Pack. Do not use after this date. Keep the pessaries and cream in a locked cabinet OUT OF CHILDREN’S REACH. The pessaries and cream should be stored below 25°C. Do not leave near a radiator on a window sill or in the bathroom.

Face –   YOU SHOULD NOT normally use on the face where the skin thins easily - BUT if your doctor has advised you to use it on the face then, if possible. the course of treatment should not last more than five days. It is important that you DO NOT let the cream get in your eyes.

(These make it easier for the active ingredient to pass through the skin).      How to use your cream   If your doctor has told you in detail HOW MUCH to use and HOW OFTEN then keep to this advice.   If you are not sure then follow the advice on the back of this leaflet.      Unless told by your doctor:   -YOU SHOULD NOT use more than this -YOU SHOULD NOT use on large areas of the body for a long time (such as nearly every day for many weeks or months).

Most people find using this cream causes no problems when used in the right amount for the correct length of time (See above as well as guidance on back of this leaflet).   IF you find your condition gets worse during treatment you may be allergic to the cream or have a skin infection which needs other treatment.    STOP USING THE CREAM AND TELL YOUR DOCTOR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE   Repeated courses of topical steroids over a long period of time may sometimes cause changes in hair growth and skin colour.    Guidance on how much cream to use If your doctor has told you in detail how to use the cream then keep to that advice otherwise:-   Two or three times a day, after washing your hands, gently rub the correct amount of cream into the skin until it has all disappeared.    For an adult:   You should find that two fingertips of cream will treat both hands or one foot three fingertips of cream will treat one arm six fingertips of cream will treat one leg fourteen fingertips of cream will treat the front and back of one trunk    Fingertip Units               Do not worry if you find you need a little more or a little less than this - it is only a rough guide.   Wash your hands before using the cream. Gently rub the correct amount into the skin until it has all disappeared.   Unless   used for treating the hands wash them again   after   using the cream. Anyone who helps to rub in the cream should also do the same or wear disposable plastic gloves.   The bacteria that cause infections like the warm, moist conditions under bandages or dressings so always clean the skin before a fresh dressing is put on.

"     PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS LEAFLET CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU START TO USE YOUR EYE DROPS   TIMOPTOL-LA (timolol maleate, MSD) Ophthalmic Gel-Forming Solution    WHAT IS IN YOUR EYE DROPS?    Active Ingredients   'Timoptol'-LA Ophthalmic Gel-Forming Solution is available in two strengths: a 0.25%  w/v solution of timolol maleate EP and a 0.5%  w/v solution of timolol maleate EP.     Other Ingredients   Benzododecinium bromide as preservative; Gellan gum; Mannitol EP; Trometamol EP; Purified water EP.   'Timoptol'-LA Ophthalmic Gel-Forming Solution is available in bottles containing 2.5 ml.    HOW DO YOUR EYE DROPS WORK?   The active ingredient in your eye drops is Timolol Maleate EP. This belongs to a group of medicines known as beta-blockers. These medicines work by reducing the pressure in your eye(s).     WHO MAKES YOUR EYE DROPS?   Your eye drops are made by Merck Sharp & Dohme-Chibret, 200 Boulevard Etienne, Clementel 63018, Clermont Ferrand, Cedex, France, for Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited, Hertford Road, Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, who hold the Product Licence for the UK and the Product Authorisation for Ireland.     WHY DO YOU NEED TO USE THESE EYE DROPS?   Your doctor has prescribed ‘Timoptol'-LA Ophthalmic Gel-Forming Solution for you because he has done some tests which show that you have a condition which causes a raised pressure in your eye(s). There are a number of different causes, such as glaucoma. Your doctor will explain which affects you.    ARE THERE PATIENTS WHO SHOULD NOT USE THESE EYE DROPS?    Yes, do not use 'Timoptol'-LA Ophthalmic Gel-Forming Solution if:     You are or think you may be pregnant     You are planning to become pregnant     You are breast-feeding     You suffer from asthma or have suffered from asthma or a similar condition in the past     You have heart disease producing a slow pulse.     You are under the age of 14.     You wear contact lenses.     You have had a bad reaction to this or similar medicine or to any of the ingredients in the past     If you think any of these apply to you, do not use the eye drops, go and talk to your doctor first and follow his advice.    WHAT ELSE SHOULD YOU KNOW BEFORE USING 'TIMOPTOL'-LA OPHTHALMIC GEL-FORMING SOLUTION?       What about driving and operating machinery?   After using the drops your vision may be temporarily blurred. This generally lasts from 30 seconds to 5 minutes after putting 'Timoptol'-LA in your eye, although in a few patients it may last up to 30 minutes or longer. You should not drive or operate machinery until you are satisfied that you can see clearly.    CAN YOU USE 'TIMOPTOL'-LA OPHTHALMIC GEL-FORMING SOLUTION WITH OTHER MEDICINES?    'Timoptol'-LA Ophthalmic Gel-Forming Solution does not usually interfere with other medicines that you may be taking. These eye drops are often used with other eye drops to treat eye conditions. There are some medicines - such as those used to treat high blood pressure - which interfere with 'Timoptol'-LA Ophthalmic Gel-Forming Solution. Your doctor knows about these. It is important, however, that you tell your doctor about all the medicines you are taking, including those bought without a prescription.    HOW SHOULD YOU USE THE EYE DROPS?    You should use the drops exactly as your doctor has advised. The dose will depend on your condition, how quickly you respond and whether you are taking any other treatment. Usually the dose is one drop of 0.25% solution once a day: Some people need a stronger dose. Your doctor will change your treatment as necessary. Do not use more or less than your doctor has prescribed. Do not stop the treatment without talking to your doctor first. You may not feel any different but the drops are helping to reduce the pressure in your eye(s) - you should use them until your doctor says you no longer need them.   If your doctor recommends that you use 'Timoptol'-LA Ophthalmic Gel-Forming Solution with another eye drop, the other medicine should be administered at least 10 minutes before ‘Timoptol'-LA Ophthalmic Gel-Forming Solution.    HOW TO PUT IN YOUR EYE DROPS   This is how to use your container of 'Timoptol'-LA Ophthalmic Gel-Forming Solution. First, wash your hands       Twist off the translucent protective overcap from the container; the seal will break and you can pull it off (Fig. 1). The protective overcap guarantees an intact package. Invert the closed container and shake once before each use. It is not necessary to shake the container more than once.         Unscrew the coloured cap and tilt your head backwards. Pull your lower eyelid down to form a pocket between your eyelid and your eye (Fig. 2). Hold the inverted container in your other hand, between your thumb and middle finger. Place the tip close to your lower eyelid and press on the base of the container with your first finger on the oval shaped 'finger pad' which is raised slightly and textured. (Fig. 3).         One drop of solution should fall into your eye. DO NOT TOUCH YOUR EYE OR EYELID WITH THE TIP OF THE CONTAINER.     Repeat steps 2 and 3 with the other eye if your doctor has instructed you to treat both eyes.     Replace the coloured cap after use.     If you are confused or unsure, speak to your doctor or pharmacist.    WHAT IF YOU FORGET A DOSE OR USE TOO MANY DROPS?   If you miss a dose of 'Timoptol'-LA Ophthalmic Gel-Forming Solution, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose, and go back to your regular dosing schedule.   If you use too many drops by mistake or swallow the contents of a container of 'Timoptol'-LA Ophthalmic Gel-Forming Solution, you may become light-headed, have difficulty breathing or feel that your heart rate has slowed. You should contact your doctor immediately.    WHAT OTHER EFFECTS COULD YOUR MEDICINE HAVE?    Like all medicines, 'Timoptol'-LA Ophthalmic Gel-Forming Solution may occasionally      ",

"    What you should know about Humalog in bottles (vials)   Please read this leaflet carefully before you start to use Humalog. This leaflet does not contain all the information about Humalog that you may need to know, so please ask your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse specialist if you have any questions. This leaflet only applies to Humalog vials.    What is in Humalog?    Your medicine is called Humalog and is used to treat diabetes. Its active ingredient is insulin lispro. This is a man-made form of human insulin. It works more quickly than normal human insulin because the insulin molecule has been changed slightly. You should normally use Humalog within the 15 minutes before a meal. Its strength is 100 units per millilitre (U-100), and each bottle contains 1000 units (10 millilitres).    Humalog also contains the inactive ingredients m-cresol, glycerol, dibasic sodium phosphate.7H20, zinc oxide and water for injection. Sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid may have been used during manufacture to adjust pH.       Always check the pack and the bottle label for the name and type of the insulin when you get it from your pharmacy. Make sure you get the Humalog that your doctor has told you to use.    Humalog is made in the laboratory by a 'recombinant DNA technology' process. It is a changed form of human insulin and is therefore different from other human insulins and from animal source insulins. Human insulin, to which it is closely related, is a natural hormone and is made by the body's pancreas.   Humalog  is made by Lilly France SA, Rue du Colonel Lilly, 67640 Fegersheim, France. The product licence is held by Eli Lilly Nederland B.V., Kritjwal 17-23, 3432 ZT Nieuwegein, Netherlands.     Why Humalog?   You get diabetes if your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in your blood. Humalog is a substitute for your own insulin when you develop diabetes and is used to provide control in the long term. It works very quickly and for a shorter time than a soluble insulin.   Your doctor may tell you to use Humalog with a longer-acting human insulin. Each of these comes with another patient information leaflet to tell you about them. Do not change your insulin unless your doctor or nurse tells you to. Be very careful if you do change insulin.     Before you inject Humalog    Make sure it is safe for you to use Humalog.       IF YOU THINK A 'HYPO' (LOW BLOOD SUGAR) IS STARTING, DO NOT INJECT HUMALOG   and do not drive. The back of this leaflet tells you how to deal with a mild 'hypo'.     If you have ever had an allergic reaction to Humalog (see section D on the back of this leaflet), tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse specialist.     If your blood sugar levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy, you may not feel the warning symptoms (see the back of the leaflet) when your blood sugar is falling too low. You must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise, and how much to do. You must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood glucose often.     A few patients who have had 'hypos' after switching from animal insulin to human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms were less obvious or different. If you often have 'hypos' or have difficulty recognising them, please discuss this with your doctor.      If you answer YES to any of the following questions, tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse specialist.      Have you recently become ill?     Are you taking any other medicines? Your insulin needs may change if you are taking the contraceptive pill, steroids, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, oral hypoglycaemics, aspirin, sulfa antibiotics, octreotide, 'beta-2 stimulants' (eg ritodrine, salbutamol or terbutaline) or some antidepressants.     Do you have trouble with your kidneys or liver?     Are you exercising more than usual?     Are you pregnant or contemplating becoming pregnant, or are you breast-feeding? Insulin requirements usually fall during the first three months of pregnancy and increase for the remainder. If you are breast-feeding, insulin and/or diet may require adjustment.     Is the patient a child under 12 years old?     Your insulin needs may also change if you drink alcohol.   You should also tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse specialist if you are planning to go abroad. The time difference between countries may mean that you have to have your injections and meals at different times from when you are at home.        Please read the back of this leaflet      What you should know about Humalog in bottles - continued Using Humalog      Dosage      You should normally inject Humalog within 15 minutes before a meal. But your doctor will have told you exactly how much to use, when to use it, and how often. These instructions are only for you. Follow them exactly and visit your diabetes clinic regularly.     If you change the type of insulin you use (for example from a human or animal insulin to Humalog), you may have to take more or less than before. This might just be for the first injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.     Inject Humalog under the skin. You should only inject it into a muscle if your doctor has told you to.      Preparing Humalog      Humalog is already dissolved in water, so you do not need to mix it. But you must use it only if it looks like water. It must be clear, have no colour and no solid pieces in it. Check this before each injection.      Injecting Humalog      First wash your hands.     Clean your skin well where you are going to make the injection. Clean the rubber stopper on the bottle, but do not remove the stopper.     Use a clean, sterile syringe and needle to pierce the rubber stopper and draw in the amount of Humalog you want. Your doctor or clinic will tell you how to do this. Do not share your needles and syringes.     Inject under the skin, as you were taught. Do not inject directly into a vein. Do not rub the area you have just injected.     Make sure you inject at least half an inch (1cm) from the last injection and that you 'rotate' the places you inject, as you have been taught.     Your doctor will tell you if you have to mix Humalog with one of the Humulin insulins. For example, If you do need to inject a mixture, draw the Humalog into the syringe before the long acting insulin. Inject the liquid as soon as you have mixed it. Do the same thing every time. You should not normally mix Humalog with one of the mixtures of human insulins. You should never mix Humalog with animal insulins.     Emergencies and overdoses: If your blood sugar is low, eat glucose tablets or sugar followed by fruit or biscuits, and then rest. This will often get you over a mild 'hypo' or minor insulin overdose. If you get worse and your breathing is shallow and your skin gets pale, tell your doctor at once. A glucagon injection can treat quite severe hypoglycaemia. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon injection. If you do not respond to glucagon, you will have to be treated in hospital. Ask your doctor to tell you about glucagon.     If 'hypos' or 'hypers' (see A and B) are not treated they can be very serious and cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even death.     Always keep spare syringes and a spare bottle of Humalog.     Always carry something to show you are diabetic.     Always carry sugar with you.      While using your insulin   Common problems of diabetes A. Hypoglycaemia ('hypo'- low blood sugar) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if:     you take too much Humalog or other insulin;     you miss or delay meals or change your diet;     you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal;     you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting);     there is a change in your need for insulin; or     you have trouble with your kidneys or liver which gets worse.     Alcohol and some medicines can affect your blood sugar levels.   The first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include:       tiredness     nervousness or shakiness     a headache     rapid heartbeat     nausea     cold sweat      B. Hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis   Hyperglycaemia ('hyper' - too much sugar in the blood) means that your body does not have enough insulin. Hyperglycaemia can be brought about by:     not taking your Humalog or other insulin;     taking less insulin than your doctor tells you to;     eating a lot more than your diet allows; or     fever, infection or emotional stress.     Hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many hours or days. They are:       sleepy feeling     flushed face     thirst     no appetite     fruity smell on the breath     sweating     Severe symptoms are heavy breathing and a rapid pulse.    Get medical help immediately.      C. Illness   If you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, your insulin needs may change.   Even when you are not eating normally, you still need insulin  . Test your urine or blood, follow your 'sick rules', and tell your doctor.     D. Allergy to insulin    Local allergy:   Some people get redness, swelling or itching around the area of the insulin injection. This usually clears up in anything from a few days to a few weeks. If this happens to you, tell your doctor.    Systemic allergy: This allergy to insulin is not common. The symptoms are:       rash over the whole body     difficulty in breathing     wheezing     blood pressure dropping     heart beating fast     sweating     If you think you are having this sort of insulin allergy with Humalog, tell your doctor at once.      E. Lipodystrophy   If you notice your skin thickening or pitting at the injection site, tell your doctor.    If you have these or any other side effects, tell your doctor.       How to store Humalog   Keep your Humalog in a fridge at between 2°-8°C. Do not put it near heat or in the sun. Do not freeze Humalog. If you cannot keep your Humalog in the fridge, you can keep it for up to 28 days at room temperature (up to 30°C). Keep your medicine where children cannot see or reach it. Do not use it after the 'Use before' date.    Remember:   This medicine is for you. Never give it to others. It may harm them, even if their symptoms are the same as yours.

You must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by frequently testing your blood glucose.     A few patients who have had 'hypos' after switching from animal insulin to human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms were less obvious or different. If you have frequent 'hypos' or have difficulty recognising them, please discuss this with your doctor.     If you answer YES to any of the following questions, tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse specialist.     Have you recently become ill?     Are you taking any other medicines? Your insulin needs may change if you are taking the contraceptive pill, steroids, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, oral hypoglycaemics, aspirin, antibiotics, some antidepressants or some medicines for high blood pressure or angina.     Do you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands?     Are you exercising more than usual?     Are you pregnant or breast-feeding?     You should also tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse specialist if you are planning to go abroad because the time differences between countries may mean that the timing of your injections and meals will have to be different from when you are at home.      Please read the back of this leaflet        What you should know about Humulin in bottles - continued    Using your insulin      Dosage      Your doctor has told you which insulin to use, how much, when, and how often to inject. This is only for you. Follow your doctor's instructions exactly and visit your diabetes clinic regularly.     If you change your insulin type (for example from animal to human), you may have to take more or less than before. This might just be the first dose or a gradual change over several weeks.     Inject under the skin. You should only inject into a muscle if your doctor has told you to. You can inject Humulin S several times a day. You will usually inject Humulin I, Humulin Lente or Humulin Zn once or twice a day. The Humulin M mixtures should normally be injected twice a day. Many people take two-thirds of their day's dose in the morning and one third in the evening.      Preparing your insulin      Humulin S is dissolved in water, so it does not need to be mixed. But you must   only   use it if it looks like water. It must be clear, have no colour and no solid particles in it.     Humulin I, Humulin Lente, Humulin Zn and Humulin M should be rolled gently between the palms of your hands just before you use them. Do not shake the bottle vigorously as bubbles and froth will make it difficult to measure the dose. All of these Humulins should look evenly cloudy or milky when you use them.     Do not use the insulin if the white material stays at the bottom of the bottle after mixing.   Do not use the insulin if the mixture is lumpy, or if solid white particles stick to the bottom or sides of the bottle, giving it a frosted look  .      Injecting the insulin      First wash your hands.     Thoroughly clean the skin where you are going to inject. Clean the rubber stopper on the bottle, but do not remove the stopper.     Use a clean, sterile syringe and needle to pierce the rubber stopper and draw in the quantity of insulin you want. Your doctor or clinic will tell you how to do this.   Do not share your needles and syringes.      Inject under the skin, as you were taught. Do not inject directly into a vein. Do not rub the area you have just injected.     Make sure you inject at least half an inch (1cm) from the previous injection and that you 'rotate' the places you inject, as you have been taught.     Your doctor will tell you if you have to mix Humulins. If you do need to inject a mixture, draw the Humulin S into the syringe before the Humulin I, Humulin Lente, or Humulin Zn. Inject as soon as you have mixed them. Do the same thing every time. Humulin M will not usually be mixed with other insulins.      Emergencies and Overdoses:   Eat glucose tablets or sugar and rest. This will often get you over a mild 'hypo' or minor insulin overdose. If you get worse and your breathing is shallow and your skin gets pale, tell your doctor at once. A glucagon injection can treat moderately severe hypoglycaemia. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon injection. If you do not respond to glucagon, you will have to be treated in hospital. Ask your doctor to tell you about glucagon.     If 'hypos' or 'hypers' (see A and B) are not treated they can be very serious and cause nausea, vomiting, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even death.     Always keep spare syringes and a spare bottle of Humulin.     Always carry something to show you are diabetic.     Always carry sugar with you.        ",

The following general information, which has been approved by the National Association for the Relief of Paget's Disease, may answer some of the questions you have about your condition and its treatment.     What is Paget's Disease7   Paget's disease is a common condition of the bone, most often seen in middle ayed or elderly people. It affects approximately one in 20 people over the age of 55 years: although most have no symptoms, these may develop with time.   Bone is constantly being broken down and rebuilt. In Paget's disease, this process happens too quickly. This over-activity is confined to small areas of the bones and does not affect the whole skeleton. Bones affected by Paget's disease become weakened and enlarged, in turn they may become misshapen or painful. When the skull is affected, Paget's disease may cause deafness; elsewhere in the body osteoarthritis may develop.     Why has your doctor prescribed treatment for you7   The aim of treatment is to control the over activity of the bone. To get the greatest benefit from this treatment you should take the full course of tablets in the way your doctor told you.   Your doctor may wish to see you some time after you finish this course of treatment. Even though you may feel well, you should keep this appointment so that your doctor can monitor your progress.

'Dyazide' is the maker's name for this medicine for the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension (high blood pressure) and/or oedema (fluid retention). The active ingredients in 'Dyazide' are triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide.    What does 'Dyazide' do?   The two active ingredients in 'Dyazide' are diuretics. They act on the kidneys to remove more water from the body and thereby increase the volume of urine.

It also removes excess water from the tissues to relieve any oedema (e.g. swollen ankles).

"    Fucithalmic    Viscous Eye Drops   This leaflet gives you helpful information about Fucithalmic eye drops. If you have any questions ask your doctor or pharmacist.    What does Fulcithalmic do?   Fucithalmic eye drops are used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis which is an infection of your eye.   Fucithalmic contains a well known antibiotic which kills the bacteria causing this infection.     As with other antibiotics for the eye     the drops should not be used if you are allergic to any of the ingredients listed overleaf.     tell your doctor if you are pregnant or breast feeding.     check the expiry date on the tube before using.     you should not wear contact lenses whilst using this treatment.        DIRECTIONS FOR USE   Use your drops as directed by your doctor. Read the label carefully       First wash your hands.     Stand or sit comfortably and tilt your head backwards.     Gently pull down your lower eyelid.     Hold the tube over your eye and look up. Try not to touch your eye with the tip of the tube.     Squeeze ONE DROP of Fucithalmic into the lower eyelid as shown. You may find a mirror useful.     If the drops are for children you may put the drops in their eyes when they are Iying down or asleep.         What should I remember when using the drops?     When the tube is squeezed Fucithalmic comes out as a thick (viscous) drop. The drop quickly becomes liquid in your eye so that you can still see clearly and so your ability to drive or operate machinery is not affected.     Fucithalmic is used twice a day, one drop in the morning and one drop in the evening.      If you forget to use the drops at the right time, use them as soon as you remember. Then go on as before.     Complete the course as recommended by your doctor, which is usually for 2 days after the eye appears normal.       AFTER USING YOUR EYE DROPS     Do not worry if your eye stings after using Fucithalmic. The stinging should soon stop. See your doctor if the stinging does not stop, or if your eye problem seems to get worse, or if you have any other unexpected problems.     You may find a white powder around your eye which is caused when the drops dry out. This is quite normal and is not harmful. It may be wiped off with cottonwool.     REMEMBER this treatment is for YOU. Do not let other people use your drops. Only a doctor can prescribe Fucithalmic.       Storing Fucithalmic     Keep your tube at room temperature (below 25°C), with the lid tightly closed.     The tube should be discarded one month after first opening.

"         WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT SEREVENT INHALER            Please read this leaflet carefully before you (or your child) start to take this medicine.  This leaflet provides a summary only: for further information or advice ask your doctor or pharmacist.     SEREVENT INHALER SHOULD BE USED TWICE A DAY   It is very important that you use Serevent every day, twice a day, in the morning and again in the evening.  This will help to keep you free of symptoms both throughout the day and during the night.    SEREVENT INHALER SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A ""RELIEVER""    Serevent should not be used for a sudden attack of wheeze or breathlessness.   If you get a sudden attack of wheezing or breathlessness, you should take one or two puffs from a quick acting reliever inhaler which your doctor may already have given you.  If you feel you are getting breathless or wheezy more often than normal, or you are using your short-acting reliever more often you should go and see your doctor.   If you take more than one inhaled medicine, make sure you know which is which and when you should use them.     OTHER IMPORTANT POINTS TO REMEMBER     Make sure that this medicine is suitable for you (or your child) (see ""Before using your inhaler"" below).     You should inhale each dose as your doctor has advised.  The directions should be given on the label: if not, or you are not sure, ask your doctor or pharmacist.     Use your inhaler every day twice a day.  DO NOT STOP treatment even if you feel better unless told to do so by your doctor.     DO NOT inhale more doses or use your inhaler more often than you were told.     You or your child should continue to take any other asthma medication prescribed by the doctor in the same way as before, unless he/she tells you otherwise.  EVEN IF YOU FEEL MUCH BETTER.     If you are told to stop using this medicine, return any unused Serevent Inhaler to your pharmacist.     Keep this medicine OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN for whom it is not intended.     This medicine is NOT usually recommended for children below 4 years of age.     If you have problems after taking this medicine you will find help in this leaflet.       HOW YOUR INHALER WORKS   The active ingredient in Serevent Inhaler is called salmeterol xinafoate.  Serevent has a ""bronchodilating"" action.  When taken regularly, it enables the small air passages of the lungs to remain relaxed and open.  This makes it easier for air to get in and out of the lungs, and so helps to ease breathing problems in asthma.  The effect of Serevent lasts 12 hours, so it should be taken each morning and each evening to help ensure that the benefits continue throughout the day and night..  Serevent does NOT act quickly enough to be used as a ""reliever"".     BEFORE USING YOUR INHALER     If you are pregnant you MUST tell your doctor before starting to use this inhaler.

After use always replace the mouthpiece cover to keep out dust and fluff.       IMPORTANT    Do not rush Stages 3, 4 and 5.  It is important that you start to breathe in as   slowly   as possible just before operating your inhaler.  Practice in front of a mirror for the first few times.  If you see ""mist"" coming from the top of the inhaler or the sides of your mouth you should start again from Stage 2.   If your doctor or the nurse has given you different instructions for using your inhaler, please follow them carefully.  Tell them if you have any difficulties.     Cleaning   Your inhaler should be cleaned at least once a week.     Pull the metal canister out of the plastic body of the inhaler and remove the mouthpiece cover.      Rinse the plastic body and mouthpiece cover in warm water.     Leave to dry in a warm place.  Avoid excessive heat.     Replace the canister and mouthpiece cover.

"    INFORMATION FOR THE PATIENT    Before this medicine is given to you please read this page carefully. At the end of this leaflet you will find more information about this medicine. This leaflet also contains some general advice on using medicines. If you have any questions or worries, ask your doctor or pharmacist.     WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT ORGAFOL    What's in this medicine     Active substance:   Urofollitrophin (human follicle stimulating hormone - FSH), 75 international units per ampoule.     Other substances:   Mannitol, disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, water for injection.    Appearance:   ORGAFOL comes in ampoules of dry white powder together with 1 millilitre ampoules of solvent. ORGAFOL comes in packs of 1 or 10 ampoules plus solvent.     How this medicine works   The action of ORGAFOL is similar to that of the natural hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).   In women this hormone is needed to ripen the egg cell; in men it is needed in the production of sperm.     Product Licence holder:   Organon Laboratories Ltd., Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge CB4 4FL. Manufactured by: N.V. Organon, Oss, The Netherlands.     What this medicine is used for   ORGAFOL is used in fertility disorders that are caused by a shortage of FSH. It is also used in in-vitro (test tube) fertilization. At the end of this leaflet you will find more information about the action and use of ORGAFOL.     When not to use this medicine   This medicine should not be given to patients with tumours of the ovaries, testes or pituitary gland.     Precautions and possible problems   There are no special precautions for use in men.    Close supervision   of female patients is extremely important. Usually blood sampling and ultrasound are performed daily. The results of these tests allow the doctor to choose the proper dose from day to day. This is very important since too high a dose may lead to overstimulation of the ovaries. This may be noticed as pain in the abdomen. Should you be troubled with pain in the abdomen, contact your doctor without delay.     Pregnancy   If treatment with ORGAFOL results in pregnancy, there is an increased chance of having twins or multiplets. There is also more chance of a miscarriage.    Using this medicine properly   ORGAFOL should only be given by a doctor or nurse How much   The dose is chosen by the doctor.   In female patients the dose is usually 75 or 150 units per day to start with, however the dose may vary according to the response. Injections are given daily or sometimes every second day for about 10 days.   In male patients injections of 75 units are given several times a week for at least 10-12 weeks.     How to administer   The powder in one ampoule should first be dissolved in the fluid in the other ampoule. The injections should be given in muscle tissue (for instance in the buttock, upper leg or upper arm).     Overdose   The toxicity of ORGAFOL has been shown to be very low. However too high a dose for more than one day may cause pain in the abdomen. if you have taken too much ORGAFOL or if you are troubled with pain in your abdomen consult your doctor immediately.     Side-effects this medicine may have   Sometimes allergic reactions like a rash, fever or pain at the injection site occur. If you suffer from any side-effects especially pain in your abdomen you should consult your doctor before taking this medicine again.     How to store this medicine   Keep the ampoules in the original package in a safe place where children cannot reach them. This medicine should be stored in the fridge or at room temperature in the dark.   There is a "" Use by"" date on this pack. The medicine should not be used after this date.    This information was last updated in February 1994      MORE ABOUT ORGAFOL   The action of ORGAFOL is similar to that of the natural hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). In both men and women this hormone is produced in the pituitary gland. Together FSH and another hormone, luteinizing hormone (LH) control the action of the sexual glands (ovaries in women and testes in men).   In women FSH ensures the monthly ripening of the follicle, a tiny cavity in which the egg cell develops. LH is needed for ovulation, the release of the egg cell. If the body itself does not produce enough FSH and LH, infertility may be the result. In these cases ORGAFOL can be used to make up the shortage. To determine the right dosage a daily check is necessary. The amount of oestrogens (female hormones) in blood or urine is measured and the follicle size is determined by means of ultrasound. When the follicle is big enough, another hormone (for instance Pregnyl) is given. This is a strong LH preparation which causes ovulation. In spite of the careful monitoring more than one egg cell may be released. This increases the chance of twins or multiplets.   In men very high LH activity is necessary for the production of sperm cells. Therefore, extra Pregnyl injections are given as well as ORGAFOL. Because the development of sperm cells takes about 74 days, treatment should be continued for at least 10 to 12 weeks before any improvement can be expected.   Infertility can also be the result of causes other than a shortage of FSH and LH. In these cases artificial techniques are sometimes used, for instance test-tube fertilization (in-vitro fertilization). For this technique several egg cells are needed and ORGAFOL is used to cause a number of egg cells to develop.     GENERAL THINGS TO REMEMBER ABOUT MEDICINES     Orgafol has been prescribed only for your current medical problem. Do not use it for other medical problems.     Do not allow other people to use your medicines and do not use medicines meant for other people.     Tell any doctor treating you what medicines you are taking. Always carry a medical information card stating which medicines you are using. This can be very important if you are involved in an accident.     Return unused medicines to the pharmacist.     Make sure that other people you live with or who look after you read this information.

"      Dianette   Please read this carefully before you start your medicine.   This booklet only provides a summary of the information available on your medicine. If you have any questions or are not sure about anything, ask your doctor or your pharmacist.    Introduction   Your doctor has chosen this medicine as a suitable treatment for your skin. This booklet explains how it works.   Although it is used for treating the skin, it is also an effective contraceptive. This means that when prescribing this medicine, your doctor has to deal with all the things that would apply to an ordinary oral contraceptive. While you are taking this medicine, you should not take any other oral contraceptive pill.     Your skin and androgens   You may be surprised to know that your body makes male sex hormones (androgens) as well as the female sex hormones (oestrogens). Your ovaries have to make androgens so that they can be changed into oestrogens.   Androgens stimulate the growth of the skin, including the grease-glands and the hairs that grow from it. They also cause the grease-glands to make large amounts of 'sebum', the oily substance that gives you greasy skin . If your body produces too much androgen or if your skin is particularly sensitive to the effects of androgens, the grease-glands may produce too much sebum. This can lead to blockage of the grease-glands which can then become infected and inflamed causing acne spots.   Androgens may also cause more growth of hair on the face and body.     How Dianette works   Every hormone is made in a part of the body, but acts somewhere else. This is because, until it becomes attached - like a key in a lock - to its own receptors in the tissues where it is meant to work, the hormone cannot act at all. The special hormone in this medicine, cyproterone acetate, attaches itself to androgen receptors in the skin, (but does not 'unlock' them), and it blocks the receptors (like the wrong key jammed in a lock) so that the androgens cannot affect the skin. This is its main action.   Your medicine also reduces the activity of the ovaries, so that much smaller amounts of hormones including androgens, are produced.     Contraception with Dianette- The contraceptive properties of Dianette   As with ordinary oral contraceptives, Dianette prevents the release of eggs (ova). It also makes the mucus in the neck of the womb thick, so that sperm cannot get through, and makes the lining of the womb unsuitable for an egg to grow on.   It prevents pregnancy as well as any ordinary combined contraceptive pill, which is one of the most effective methods of contraception. Therefore you do not need to use another contraceptive method to prevent pregnancy while taking this medicine, except as described under ""What to do if you forget to take a pill and are relying on Dianette for contraceptive cover"", ""Stomach upsets"" and ""Taking other medicines with Dianette"".    The name of your medicine is:   Dianette     What does your medicine contain?   Each pack of Dianette contains 21 beige sugar-coated tablets. Each tablet contains 2 mg of the anti-androgen, cyproterone acetate and 35 micrograms of the oestrogen, ethinyloestradiol.   Each tablet also contains the following inactive  ingredients: lactose, maize starch, povidone, talc, magnesium stearate (E572), sucrose, polyethylene glycol 6,000, calcium carbonate (E170), titanium dioxide (E171),glycerin (E422),montan glycol wax, yellow ferric oxide pigment (E 172).   Each pack of Dianette contains 3 memo strips of 21 tablets. Packs containing 1 memo strip of 21 tablets are also available to doctors.   Dianette is a combination of an oestrogen and an anti-androgen.   The product licence is held by: Schering Health Care Ltd, The Brow, Burgess Hill, West Sussex RH15 9NE.    Product licence number:   0053/0190 Dianette is manufactured by: Schering AG, Berlin, Germany     Uses in women only:     severe acne which hasn't improved after the long-term use of oral antibiotics     excessive hair growth on the face and body (moderately severe hirsutism)       Reasons for not taking Dianette   You must not take this medicine if you have any of these:     you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant.     you are breast feeding.     blood clots in the legs, lungs, eyes, or anywhere else or have ever had these. If you have had a heart attack or if you have any medical condition which makes you more at risk of developing blood clots.     abnormal red blood cells (sickle-cell anaemia).     disorders of blood fat (lipid) metabolism.     cancer of the breast or of the lining of the womb (mammary or endometrial carcinoma) or have ever had either of these conditions.     abnormal bleeding from your vagina of unknown cause.     certain types of jaundice (Dubin-Johnson or Rotor syndromes).     severe diabetes with changes to the blood vessels.     liver tumours or have ever had these.     any other long or short term liver disease.     allergy to any of the ingredients of Dianette.     Do not take this medicine if you have had any of these conditions when you were pregnant:     itching of your whole body (pruritus of pregnancy).     the rash known as herpes gestationis     worsening of inherited deafness (otosclerosis).     yellowing of the skin (jaundice).       What you should know before taking Dianette   Before you start taking this medicine your pelvic organs, breasts and blood pressure should be checked by your doctor and these checks should be repeated regularly. The doctor will also make sure you are not pregnant.   If anyone in your family has had any illness caused by blood clots, or a heart attack, or a stroke at a young age, tell your doctor.   The following conditions need watching carefully while you are taking Dianette:   If you have:     severe depressive states, past or present.     varicose veins.     diabetes (diabetes mellitus) or a tendency towards diabetes.     high blood pressure (hypertension).     fits (epilepsy).     the inherited form of deafness known as osteoporosis     the disease of the nervous system called multiple sclerosis.     the inherited disease called porphyria.     calcium deficiency with cramps (tetany).     the movement disorder called Sydenham's chorea.     breast problems, past or present.     diseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardio-vascular diseases).     kidney diseases.       disturbed liver function.     you are overweight (obese}.     an intolerance of contact lenses.     systemic lupus erythematosus - SLE (inflammation of connective tissue).     asthma.     uterine fibroids (benign tumour of the womb).     gallstones.     migraine.     brown patches on the face and body (chloasma).     any disease that is prone to worsen during pregnancy.      Or, if     you have had inflamed veins (phlebitis).     anyone in your family has had breast cancer.     anyone in your family has had any illness caused by blood clots, or a heart attack or stroke at a young age.     If any of these conditions gets worse or you have them for the first time this may be a sign that you should stop taking this medicine.   When you stop taking this medicine it may take some time for your regular periods to return.      Sunbeds/sun-ray lamps (ultraviolet)   Ultraviolet lamps are used by some women for acne as well as to tan the skin. This is not a very useful treatment for acne. Ultraviolet lamps and prolonged sunbathing should be avoided if you are taking Dianette as their use increases the chance of chloasma, a patchy discoloration of the skin (as it does with ordinary contraceptives).     Taking other medicines with Dianette   Some medicines may stop Dianette working properly as a contraceptive. If you are taking any other medicine while you are relying on Dianette for contraception, be sure to tell your doctor (or dentist). Your doctor (or dentist) can tell you whether you should use extra contraceptive precautions and for how long.   Medicines which can sometimes stop Dianette from working properly are antibiotics (such as ampicillin and rifampicin), griseofulvin (which is used to treat fungal infections)- phenylbutazone (which is used as an anti-inflammatory drug to treat some types of joint diseases); phenytoin, primidone, phenobarbitone and some other medicines used in people with epilepsy, and carbamazepine (which can be used to treat epilepsy or other illnesses).   If you are relying on Dianette for contraception and you are taking any of these medicines you will also need to use an extra contraceptive method (condoms or cap plus spermicide) while you are taking the other medicine and for 7 days after you stop taking it. If your present pack ends before those 7 days, start the next pack the next day without a break. If you run two packs together you may not have a period until the end of two packs, but this is not harmful. If you do not have a period after the second pack, you must talk to your doctor before you start the next pack.   If your doctor prescribes oral antibiotics as well as this medicine for the treatment of your acne, you must make it clear to your doctor if you want to rely on this method for contraception. Medicines applied to the skin, including antibiotics, will not affect the contraceptive reliability of Dianette.   If you are taking rifampicin, and you are relying on this medicine for contraception, you will need to use another method of contraception as well as Dianette. You should do this while you are taking the rifampicin and for 4 weeks after you stop.   If you are diabetic your doctor may after the dose of medicine required to treat your diabetes.   If you are in doubt, check with your doctor or pharmacist.     Stomach upsets   Being sick or having very bad diarrhoea may stop this medicine from working properly. If this happens and you are relying on this method for contraception carry on taking it as usual, and also use another method of contraception (condoms or cap plusspermicide), until 7 days after you have recovered from the stomach upset. If you finish your pack before these 7 days, start the next pack the next day without a break. If you run two packs together you may not have a period until the end of two packs, but this is not harmful. If you do not have a period after the second pack, you must talk to your doctor before starting the next pack. If your stomach upset continues for some time, consult your doctor who may consider another form of contraception.     Warnings    Pregnancy:   Androgens (male sex hormones) are necessary for the development of the sexual organs in males, and the strong action of cyproterone acetate (contained in Dianette) against androgens has been found to prevent the normal development of these organs during pregnancy in experimental animals. The degree of risk in humans of such an effect (known as feminisation ) is uncertain and for this reason it is absolutely essential that you should not be pregnant while taking Dianette. If you think you might be pregnant, stop taking Dianette and consult your doctor immediately. Use another method of contraception such as a condom until you see your doctor.   Apart from its strong action against androgens, Dianette has many properties in common with combined pills (combinations of two hormones), which must not be taken during treatment with Dianette. Although the following statements refer to combined oral contraceptives, they should, for practical purposes be taken to apply to Dianette also.   It has been suggested, on the basis of statistical evidence, that the risk of developing various disorders of the circulation of the blood is slightly greater in women who take the combined pill than in those who do not. This can lead to, for example, deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in the leg), strokes (blood clots and haemorrhages from the blood vessels of the brain), heart attacks or pulmonary embolism (blood clots blocking the arteries of the lungs). People do not always fully recover from these disorders, and, very rarely, they are fatal. Studies suggest that these disorders occur less often with modern low-dose oral contraceptives than with older pills.   Certain conditions increase the risk of thrombosis. They include:     smoking.     obesity.     some diseases of the heart and blood vessels.     diabetes.     migraine.     a major operation or period of immobilisation (e.g. you are in bed after an accident or operation or you have a plaster cast on a broken leg).     if any members of your family have suffered from thromboembolic diseases (e.g. deep vein thrombosis, stroke or heart attack) at a young age.     varicose veins.     If any of these conditions apply to you before you decide to take this medicine or while you are taking it you must discuss them with your doctor.   The risk of arterial thrombosis (e.g. heart attack and stroke) associated with the pill increases with age, and this risk is increased by cigarette smoking. For this reason, the use of combined pills by women in the older age-group, especially those who also smoke, is discouraged.   Signs and symptoms of blood clots are given in the section Reasons for stopping Dianette immediately .   The pill does give a substantial degree of protection against cancers of the ovary and the lining of the womb. An increased risk of cervical cancer in long-term users of the pill has been reported in some studies. It is uncertain whether this increased risk is caused by the pill as it could be due to the effects of sexual behaviour and other factors.   The evidence linking use of the pill and breast cancer is unclear. Some studies suggest an increased risk of breast cancer in women below the age of 35, the risk increasing the longer the pill is used. Any   possible increased risk of breast cancer with combined pills is, however, likely to be small.   On rare occasions, the use of the pill has led to liver diseases such as jaundice and benign liver tumours, and, very rarely, it has been associated with some forms of malignant liver tumours (cancer) in long-term users. Liver tumours may lead to life-threatening intra-abdominal haemorrhage (bleeding in the abdomen). Therefore, if you have pain in the upper abdomen that does not soon clear up, tell your doctor. Also, if your skin becomes yellow (jaundice) you must tell your doctor.   Certain conditions may sometimes get worse during use of the pill. The diseases are those listed under ""What you should know before taking Dianette"".     Reasons for stopping Dianette immediately   If you experience any of the following conditions take no further tablets of Dianette and consult your doctor immediately. In the meantime use another method of contraception such as a condom.     migraine for the first time, or if existing migraine occurs more often than before.     unusually bad headaches or if you have headaches more often than before.     sudden changes to your eyesight, hearing, speech, sense of smell, taste or touch.     dizziness or fainting.     unusual pains in your leg or unusual swelling of your arms or legs, sharp pains in your chest or sudden shortness of breath, crushing pains or feelings of heaviness in your chest, coughing for no apparent reason or if one side of your body suddenly becomes very weak or numb. These may be symptoms of blood clot formation or symptoms of an inflammation of veins combined with the formation of blood clots (thrombophlebitis).     your skin becomes yellow (jaundice), you develop hepatitis (inflammation of the liver) or if your whole body starts itching.     an increase in the number of fits (epileptic seizures).     a large increase in your blood pressure.     severe depression.     severe upper abdominal pains or unusual swelling of your abdomen.     definite worsening of conditions which had got worse during a previous pregnancy or whilst taking the pill in the past.     pregnancy.     Surgery or immobilisation. You must stop Dianette six weeks before a planned major operation (e.g. stomach surgery), if you are having any surgery to the legs, or medical treatment for varicose veins. Also if you are immobilised for a long time (e.g. you are in bed after an accident or operation or you have a plaster cast on a broken leg). Your doctor will advise you when to start taking Dianette again.       How to take Dianette   If you are relying on this medicine for contraception, it is important that you follow these instructions carefully and read the section ""Contraception with Dianette - The contraceptive properties of Dianette"".   This pack is designed to help you remember to take your pills.      When to start   If you are new to Dianette or are starting it again after a break, take your first tablet on the first day of bleeding of your next period. For other users, follow instructions for ""Changing from another type of oral contraceptive"", ""Starting Dianette after having a baby"" or ""Starting Dianette after a miscarriage or an abortion"".Start with a pill marked with the correct day of the week. For instance, if your period starts on a Wednesday, start with a pill marked 'Wed"".     Taking your first pack of Dianette   After taking your first pill, take one pill each day, following the directions of the arrows, until you have finished all 21 pills in the pack.   You should try to take the pill at the same time every day, for example, after breakfast.   Swallow each pill whole, with water if necessary.   By starting in this way you will have contraceptive protection at once.     Your seven pill-free days   After you have taken ail 21 tablets, you have 7 days when you take no tablets. A few days after you have taken the last pill from each pack you will have a period. Your periods will be regular, probably lighter than before and almost always painless. The feelings that often make the last days before a period unpleasant (called premenstrual syndrome) usually disappear. You are very unlikely to become pregnant during the 7 day break from taking the pill, as long as you have taken your pills correctly, and start the next pack on time.     Taking your next pack of Dianette   Start taking your next pack of Dianette after 7 pill-free days. Each new pack will begin on the same day of the week as the one before, so it is easy to remember when to start again. You should start taking your next pack after 7 days, even if you are still bleeding. The table ""How to take Dianette"" should help you to take the pills properly.     Changing from another type of oral contraceptive 21 day pill   If you are taking a 21 day contraceptive pill, finish that pack and then start taking Dianette the next day. Do not leave a gap between packs. Start with a pill marked with the correct day of the week. Then follow the instructions as described before (see ""Taking your first pack of Dianette""). By starting in this way you will have contraceptive protection at once. You may not have a period until the end of the first Dianette pack, but this is not harmful. You may have some bleeding on pill-taking days, but do not worry.    Every Day (ED} combined pill {28 day pill)   Dianette should be started after taking the last active tablet from the Every Day pill pack. if you are not sure which tablets are the active ones, ask your doctor or pharmacist. The first Dianette tablet is taken the next day, which means that you do not leave a gap between packs. Start with a pill marked with the correct day of the week. Return to your pharmacist any remaining inactive tablets from your old Every Day pack. Then follow the instructions as before (see ""Taking your first pack of Dianette""). By starting in this way you will have contraceptive protection at once. You may not have a period until the end of the first pack, but this is not harmful. You may have some bleeding on pill-taking days, but do not worry.     Mini pill (progestogen-only pill)   The first Dianette tablet should be taken on the first day of the period, even if you have already taken a mini pill on that day. Return to your pharmacist any mini pills left in your old pack. Start with a pill marked with the correct day of the week. Follow the instructions as before (see ""Taking your first pack of Dianette""). By starting in this way you will have contraceptive protection at once.      Starting Dianette after having a baby   If you have just had a baby, your doctor may advise you to start taking Dianette 21 days after delivery. You do not have to wait for a period. You will need to use another method of contraception until you start Dianette and for the first 7 days of pill taking. Follow the instructions as before (see ""Taking your first pack of Dianette""). You must not breastfeed if you take Dianette.       Starting Dianette after a miscarriage or an abortion   If you have just had a miscarriage or an abortion your doctor may advise you to start using Dianette immediately. Follow the instructions as before (see ""Taking your first pack of Dianette"").     While you are taking Dianette     When can you expect to see improvement in your skin?   Unlike treatments that are rubbed on the skin, this treatment does not so much attack existing spots as reduce the formation of new spots. It does this by working at the point at which the androgens stimulate the grease-glands to produce too much grease. So the first thing that you will notice is that your skin has become much less greasy. This should be obvious in the first few weeks. After about three months you should see a definite improvement in acne. If you are taking this medicine to treat excessive hair growth on your body or face, you may have to wait a few months possibly longer, to see a definite improvement.     How long can you take Dianette?   Your doctor may stop treating you with this medicine when your skin is completely clear, or the amount of body and facial hair growth has decreased. You will be able to have further courses of treatment, for as long as is necessary, if the problem keeps returning.     What to do if you miss a period   If you have no bleeding in the 7 day break, whether you have missed tablets or not, tell your doctor as soon as possible and do not start another pack until your doctor tells you to. In the meantime, do not have sex unless you use condoms or a cap plus spermicide.     What if you have bleeding between periods?   A small number of women may have a little breakthrough bleeding or spotting while taking this medicine, especially during the first few months. Normally this bleeding is nothing to worry about, and will stop in a day or two. Keep taking the pills as usual, and the problem should disappear after the first few packs.   If the bleeding keeps on returning, is annoying or long-lasting, talk to your doctor. Also, if you start to have breakthrough bleeding for the first time after being on this medicine for a long time, you should see your doctor.   Unexpected bleeding may also be a sign of irregular pill-taking, so try to take your pill at the same time every day.    What to do if you forget to take a pill and are relying on Dianette for contraceptive cover     If you are more than 12 hours late in taking a pill, or have missed more than one pill   Contraceptive protection may be lower, so you must use extra protection. Follow the instructions for the 7-day rule.    7-day rule     take the most recent 'late' pill and continue to take your next pills at your normal times   and      use an extra contraceptive method (condoms or cap plus spermicide) for the next 7 days   and      if your present pack ends before the 7 days do, start the next pack the next day, without a break. This means taking a pill every day during your normal 7 pill-free days. You will not have a period until you have finished the next pack, but this is not harmful. You may see some bleeding on pill-taking days, but do not worry. If no bleeding occurs in the 7 day break see the section entitled ""What to do if you miss a period. ""        If one pill is 12 hours late or less   Don't worry. Contraceptive protection should not be affected if you take the late pill at once, and keep taking your next pills at the usual time.      What should you do if you lose a pill?   If you lose a pill, the easiest thing to do is take the last pill of the pack in place of the lost pill. Then take all the pills on their proper days. Your cycle will be one day shorter than normal, but contraceptive protection  is not affected. After your 7 pill-free days you will have a new starting-day, one day earlier than before. Should you lose a pack of pills halfway through, ask your doctor or pharmacist what to do.     What if you want to have a baby?   The bleeding you have after each pack (including the last pack) is not a true period. Your doctor relies on the date of your last true period before you get pregnant to tell you when your baby will be born. So, if you stop taking Dianette to have a baby, use another method of contraception until you have had a true period. However, it will not be harmful if you become pregnant straight away.    Overdosage   Overdosage may cause nausea, vomiting and, in females, withdrawal bleeding. You should consult your doctor who will be able to advise you what action, if any, is necessary.     Possible side-effects   Sometimes unwanted effects occur with Dianette.   These can be mild or serious.    Mild reactions   Sometimes mild unwanted effects can occur in the first few months after starting Dianette.     bleeding and spotting between your periods can sometimes occur hr the first few months but this usually stops once your body has adjusted to Dianette. If it continues, becomes heavy or starts again, contact your doctor.     headaches.     feeling sick, being sick and stomach upsets.     sore breasts.     depressive moods, loss of interest in sex.     changes in weight.     chloasma (yellow brown patches on the skin). This may happen even if you have been using Dianette for a number of months. Chloasma may be reduced by avoiding too much sunlight.     poor tolerance of contact lenses.       Serious reactions   Most serious reactions have sometimes been associated  with contraceptive pills that contain oestrogen and progestogen, for example thrombosis (the formation of a clot in blood vessels) or liver disease.   These are explained more fully in the ""Warnings"" section.   If you think that you have a serious adverse reaction to Dianette, stop taking your tablets and consult your doctor as soon as possible.   If you think you have an unwanted effect due to Dianette, even if it is not included in this booklet, tell your doctor or a pharmacist about it.    Effect on blood tests   The use of this medicine may affect the results of certain laboratory tests. Always tell your doctor or the laboratory staff that you are using Dianette.    Expiry date:   The expiry date is printed on the pack Do not use after this date.    Storage:   Store all medicines out of the reach of children.    Date of last revision of this booklet:   12 December 1995  Dianette is a registered trademark of Schering AG Skin care tips What can you do to clear your acne   In addition to asking a pharmacist or your doctor for help, you can also help yourself by being aware of the things that can affect your acne.    Does washing alone heal acne?   Washing by itself is not going to heal your acne. All it does is keep the surface of the skin free from excess grease. While having clean skin is certain to have some beneficial effect, take care not to over-clean it. A certain amount of sebum is necessary to prevent the skin from becoming too dry, so excessive washing and scrubbing may do more harm than good.     TIP -   Try to use a simple, unperfumed soap. If the soap you are using irritates your skin, use another one.      Do cosmetics aggravate acne?   it is tempting for girls to try to hide their acne with make-up. This rarely hides the spots, and it blocks the skin pores - a situation almost guaranteed to make the acne worse.   If you want to wear make-up, use it sparingly and choose a light non-greasy lotion, not cold creams.   TIP -   Face powders, lipsticks, eyebrow pencil, eyeliner and eyelash make-up virtually never produce acne and rare/y irritate the skin.      Are there any foods which should be avoided if you have acne?   Medical evidence has not shown conclusively that any particular foods cause acne. But if you do find that some foods seem to be related to sudden acne flare-ups, they try to avoid them for a while and see what happens. On food in general, your body and its ability to fight acne from the inside can only benefit from being fed a healthy and balanced diet.     Can other things make your acne worse?   Exposure to oils and grease (e.g. as a mechanic) can cause acne, as can other industrial chemicals. Very high temperatures, such as in a bakery, can result in excessive sweating and a worsening of your acne. On the other hand, sunlight is good for spots, and your acne may well improve during the summer months. However, don't use a sunlamp, or sunbathe for a long time without first taking advice from your doctor.     Are there times when acne gets worse?   Yes, too much stress and worry can often make your acne worse. Students often find that their acne flares up before and during exams, because stress increases the levels of hormones that induce acne. Also, under stress, people tend to pick at their acne.    Can the menstrual cycle affect acne?   Yes it is not uncommon for acne to get worse for about 7-10 days before the onset of menstruation. This is due to the monthly changes in hormone levels.   TIP -   Dianette or certain contraceptive pills, should lessen the effect of pre-menstrual acne.      Does squeezing help clear up acne?   Although the temptation is sometimes very strong, try not to squeeze your spots. Vigorous squeezing damages the skin and tends to spread the infection and inflammation and to delay healing. In some cases, it can cause permanent scarring. On those occasions when you just can't help yourself, squeeze the spot gently and be sure to dab on some disinfectant afterwards.     How long does it take for acne to disappear?   Just about everything concerning acne is 'unfair' and the length of time it takes to respond to treatment is no exception. Even the most effective products take time, sometimes a long time, before you can see any significant improvement. It will usually take several months of treatment before your acne clears up.   You should also realise that as long as your tendency to acne persists, you are likely to need further treatment from time to time. So try to be patient, keep using your treatment regularly, and follow your doctor's instructions.     Does acne only occur in teenagers?   No, although it is mainly a teenage problem, acne can occur both in early childhood and in adults even into their thirties and forties.     Can clothes affect acne?   Yes. If you have acne on your body, try to wear light loose clothes and avoid irritating fabrics such as wool and synthetic materials. Keep your underclothes, and clothes that come into contact with areas affected by acne, very clean.      ",
"     PATIENT INFORMATION LEAFLET   Your doctor has prescribed Questran or Questran Light for you. Please read this leaflet before you take your medicine.   It gives a summary of information about your medicine.  If you want to know more, or are not sure about anything, ask your doctor or pharmacist.    Remember   This medicine is for YOU.  Only a doctor can prescribe it.  NEVER give it to anyone else.  It may harm them even if they have the same symptoms as you.     Q.What is in Questran or Questran Light sachets?   A.The active ingredient is called cholestyramine.  Questran and Questran Light sachets each contain 4 grams cholestyramine but the Questran Light sachets contain less sugar and overall powder bulk.   Other ingredients in Questran are: acacia, citric acid anhydrous, flavours, polysorbate 80, propylene glycol alginate, sucrose, sunset yellow.   Other ingredients in Questran Light are: aspartame (30 mg /sachet), citric acid anhydrous, colloidal silicon dioxide anhydrous, flavours, propylene glycol alginate, quinoline yellow, sucrose, xanthan gum.   Questran and Questran Light are supplied in packs of 60 or 180 sachets.   Questran and Questran Light belong to a group of medicines called bile acid binding resins.     Q. Who supplies Questran or Questran Light sachets?   Product Licence holder:    Bristol-Myers Squibb Holdings Ltd T/A Bristol-Myers Pharmaceuticals 141-149 Staines Road Hounslow   Product Authorisation holder:   Bristol-Myers Squibb Holdings Ltd T/A Bristol-Myers Pharmaceuticals Dublin Ireland       Manufacturer:     Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd Moreton, Merseyside L46 1QW       Product Licence numbers:     Questran 0125/5009R Questran Light 0125/0192     Product Authorisation numbers:     Questran 48/20/ 1 Questran Light 48/20/2      Q.What is this medicine for?   A.Questran and Questran Light are used to lower your body's level of cholesterol (a type of fat) and should always be used together with a low fat diet.  Questran and Questran Light work exclusively in the digestive system to absorb the cholesterol-containing bile acids which then pass out through the body in the faeces.  You probably feel quite well and would not notice you have high cholesterol, but too much of it in the blood stream is one of the important causes of heart attacks.  Your doctor has prescribed Questran or Questran Light to try to reduce the chances of this happening.   Questran and Questran Light may also be used to help stop some types of diarrhoea or itching.  If you are taking the medicine for these conditions, then you may not need to adhere to a low fat diet.    BEFORE TAKING YOUR MEDICINE      Q.Should I be taking Questran or Questran Light?   A.DO NOT take these sachets if:      you have had an allergic reaction to any of the ingredients of Questran or Questran Light.      you have a disease which results in complete biliary obstruction, such as gallstones.  Check with your doctor if you are unsure.     This product is   NOT FOR USE   in children under 6 years old.     Q.Can I take any other medicines?   A.Questran and Questran Light may change the effect of other medicines by stopping them from working so well.  Questran preparations stay in the digestive system and can stop other medicines from getting into the bloodstream by acting like a sponge and stopping them from being absorbed by the body.  To avoid this, the time at which you take your medicines is very important.   Any other medicines you are taking should be taken at a different time from your dose of Questran or Questran Light.  For example, if you take a dose of Questran or Questran Light at 9.00am, any other medicines should be taken at least one hour before the Questran or Questran Light dose (this means before 8.00am), or 4-6 hours after your dose of Questran or Questran Light (this would be 1.00 - 3.00pm).   If you are unsure, ask your doctor or pharmacist.  Always tell your doctor about any other medicines you are using, even those you have bought over the counter in a pharmacy or elsewhere, e.g. supermarket.     Q.What if I am pregnant or breast-feeding?   A.If you are pregnant, or there is a possibility you might become pregnant, or you are breast-feeding while you are taking Questran or Questran Light, tell your doctor as soon as possible.     Q.Is it all right to drink alcohol?   A.Alcohol intake should be kept within the guidelines suggested by your doctor.  It is particularly important to stick to these as alcohol can increase your cholesterol level.     Q.Is it all right to drive?   A.There is no reason why you cannot continue driving while you are being treated with Questran or Questran Light unless your doctor advises against it.    TAKING YOUR MEDICINE      Q.How should I take Questran or Questran Light sachets?   A.The label will tell you how many sachets and how often your doctor wants you to take this medicine.  To lower your cholesterol, the usual dose is 3-6 sachets each day.  Your dose may be taken as a single daily dose or in divided doses up to 4 times a day.  To relieve itching, the usual dose is one or two sachets each day.  The dose in children depends on the child's weight which your doctor will work out.  The contents of one sachet should be sprinkled evenly on the surface of 150 ml (4-6 fluid oz) of water or fruit juice.  Allow to stand for one or two minutes. After the powder becomes wetted, stir or shake to make a uniform suspension.  Questran or Questran Light can be mixed with water, fruit juice, skimmed milk, thin soups or pulpy fruits with a high moisture content e.g. apple sauce.    DO NOT take the medicine in its dry form, since it could cause you to choke.      Q.Should I take the sachets with food?   A.It does not matter when you take your Questran or Questran Light in relation to food.     Q.How long should I take Questran or Questran Light sachets?   A.Continue with the sachets until your doctor tells you otherwise.  It is important you take this medicine.  Your doctor will tell you to come  back for regular check-ups.  Keep your doctor’s appointments even if you feel well.     Q.What if I miss a dose?   A.If you miss a dose do not worry.  Take it as soon as you remember.  However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue as before.  DO NOT take a double dose to make up for the one you missed.     Q.What if I take too many sachets, or a child swallows some?   A.Go to your nearest hospital Casualty Department or tell your doctor immediately.  If you are going to the hospital, take the empty container and any remaining sachets with you.    UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS      Q.Are there any unwanted effects of Questran or Questran Light?   A.Any medicine may cause some unwanted effects.  Taking Questran or Questran Light is much like changing your diet.  Some people may develop constipation or feel slightly bloated or suffer from a little wind during the first few days of treatment.  These normally reduce over time and frequently disappear if treatment is continued.  However, check with your doctor if these effects continue or are bothersome.   If you are starting Questran or Questran Light for the first time, by increasing the dose slowly you will minimise these effects.  Usually patients start with one sachet daily for a week or so, then increase the dose by one sachet every week until they are taking the number of sachets the doctor has prescribed.   Large doses of Questran may cause diarrhoea.  After using Questran or similar products for a long time, a few patients have experienced unusual tiredness and rapid or deep breathing.   If you notice any other unusual effects while taking Questran or Questran Light, check with your doctor or pharmacist.   Long-term treatment with high doses of Questran or Questran Light may reduce the body's absorption of fat-soluble vitamins from the diet (vitamins A, D and K).  In some patients, reduced absorption of vitamin K could increase the time it takes for the blood to clot.  If you are worried about this, please discuss it with your doctor who may suggest a vitamin supplement.    LOOKING AFTER YOUR MEDICINE   You will see an 'EXPIRY DATE' on the packaging of Questran or Questran Light.  Do not use after this date.   Keep all your medicines where children cannot reach them.  Keep Questran or Questran Light sachets at room temperature (i.e. below 30°C).  They should not get too hot or damp; so do not leave the sachets near a radiator, on a window sill, or in the bathroom.   If your doctor decides to stop the sachets, take the remainder back to a pharmacy.

Before receiving Amsidine   Before you are given Amsidine, please answer the following questions:     Are you pregnant, trying to become pregnant, or breast feeding?     Have you ever had a reaction to amsacrine?     Are you taking any other medicines?     Are you already having other treatments for cancer or have you received treatments in the past?     Have you ever had kidney or liver disease?     Have you been told that the potassium level in your blood is too low?     Are you under 12 years old?

WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW BEFORE YOU START YOUR TREATMENT    BEFORE TAKING ANY MEDICINE   - always inform your doctor if you are pregnant, think you might be pregnant or are trying to become pregnant.     WHEN NOT TO USE YOUR MEDICINE           Do not use Sporanox  - if you are pregnant or could become pregnant  (e.g. by not using contraception)     if you think that you may have had an allergic reaction to Sporanox, any of the inactive ingredients, or another antifungal medicine in the past. An allergic reaction may be recognised as a rash itching, swollen face or lips, or shortness of breath.     if you are taking a hay fever or antihistamine product containing terfenadine or astemizole.     if you are taking cisapride (a drug used for certain digestive problems) or the oral tranquillisers, midazolam or triazolam.     Inform your doctor before taking the medicine if any of the above applies to you. Your doctor will then decide whether Sporanox is suitable for you.     SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS Children and the elderly   Sporanox is not normally prescribed for use in children under the age of 12 or for the elderly. However, your doctor may use his judgement to prescribe it in special cases.     Liver problems   Tell your doctor if you have, or have had a liver problem such as jaundice.   See your doctor immediately if any of the following appear during your course of treatment with Sporanox: severe lack of appetite, feeling sick, being sick, unusual tiredness, stomach pain, unusually dark urine, or pale stools   If you have taken Sporanox continuously for more than one month, your doctor may want to check your liver by testing your blood.     Kidney problems   Tell your doctor if you have a kidney problem as the dose of Sporanox may have to be changed.    Other precautions   You should also tell your doctor immediately if you have any unusual feelings of tingling, numbness or weakness, in your hands or feet whilst taking Sporanox Pregnancy       Do not take Sporanox if you are pregnant. If you are of child bearing age and could become pregnant, you should take adequate contraceptive precautions to make sure that you do not become pregnant while you are taking your medicine. As Sporanox remains in the body for some time after you stop taking it, you should continue to use some form of contraception for one month after your treatment with Sporanox is finished.   If you do find that you are pregnant after starting a course of Sporanox capsules, stop taking them and tell your doctor straight away.     Breast feeding           Do not breast-feed if you are taking Sporanox, as small amounts of the medicine could be present in your milk. Ask your doctor for advice.    Other medicines           Always tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines because taking some medicines together can be harmful.   For example, you should not take Sporanox if you are taking an antihistamine containing terfenadine or astemizole for hay fever or allergy. You should not take Sporanox if you are taking cisapride (a drug used for certain digestive problems) or midazolam or triazolam (drugs used as sleeping pills). Your doctor will need to know if you are using the antibiotic rifampicin or anti-epileptics such as phenytoin, as they may stop Sporanox from working properly.   Your doctor may need to alter the dose of certain other medicines before you begin your course of Sporanox. These include blood thinning agents, the heart drug digoxin, medicines known as cyclosporin A and tacrolimus which are usually given after an organ transplant. Special care is required if the tranquilliser midazolam is given intravenously during treatment with Sporanox. Sporanox can make the side effects of a medicine known as vincristine more severe and your doctor may need to change the dose of either or both of these medicines.   There must be sufficient stomach acid to ensure that Sporanox is properly absorbed by the body. Therefore, medicines that neutralise stomach acid such as medicines for indigestion, stomach ulcers or heartburn, should not be taken sooner than 2 hours after Sporanox.      HOW TO USE YOUR MEDICINE           Always take Sporanox immediately after a meal as this helps the body absorb the medicine.   Swallow the correct number of capsules whole with some liquid.    HOW MUCH SHOULD YOU TAKE?    Your doctor will tell you how many Sporanox capsules to take and for how long you should continue to take them. Always read the label on your medicine and follow your doctor's instructions carefully. Ask your pharmacist if you are not sure about anything.   Your doctor will probably have recommended one of the following treatment courses with Sporanox:     Yeast infection of the vagina (thrush) capsules for one day always taken as: two capsules, followed by another two capsules ideally 12 hours later (e.g. 2 capsules in the morning and 2 in the evening).     Yeast infection of the mouth (oral thrush) 1 capsule each day for 15 days     For fungal infections of the skin the dosage depends on your condition. It is likely to be either:      2 capsules each day for 7 days or 1 capsule each day for 15 days      or   1 capsule each day for 30 days     For treatment or prevention of fungal infections of other parts of the body the dosage and length of treatment varies depending on the type of infection. Your doctor may sometimes prescribe Sporanox at different dosages or for different lengths of time. Talk to your doctor if this applies to you.     It is important that you carry on taking your medicine for as long as your doctor has told you to. Do not stop your treatment just because you feel better   With skin infections, the patches on your skin may only disappear completely a few weeks after you have finished your treatment with Sporanox. This is because your skin will only appear normal once new skin has grown, even though Sporanox has already killed the fungus causing the infection.      WHAT TO DO IF YOU FORGET TO TAKE YOUR MEDICINE   If you miss any capsules, take the next dose as usual and continue your course until the capsules are finished.    IF YOU TAKE TOO MUCH OF YOUR MEDICINE    IF YOU THINK YOUR MEDICINE MAKES YOU FEEL ILL     Occasionally the use of Sporanox may cause  minor side effects such as headache, dizziness, feeling sick, abdominal pain, upset stomach, constipation or changes in menstrual bleeding. It is unusual for people to have an allergic reaction to Sporanox. However, if you experience a skin rash, itching, shortness of breath and/or a swollen face, stop taking Sporanox and contact your doctor immediately.   In patients taking Sporanox for long periods, occasionally swelling, muscle weakness, jaundice, very dark urine, pale stools, tingling sensation in the limbs and rarely hair loss have occurred. In such cases, stop taking the medication and see your doctor immediately.   If your medicine affects you in any other way, you should tell your doctor or pharmacist.   See also Special Precautions section, above.     HOW TO STORE YOUR MEDICINE         As with all medicines, Sporanox capsules should be kept in a safe place where children cannot reach them. Store the capsules in their carton at room temperature (15°C-30°C) in a dry place and out of strong sun light. Do not use the capsules after the expiry date printed on the packaging. Always return any left over medicine to your pharmacist. Only keep it if your doctor tells you to.   This leaflet was prepared in October 1995.      ",

"      Voltarol Suppositories 12.5 mg Geigy        INFORMATION FOR PARENTS What you need to know about Voltarol suppositories 12.5mg   Your doctor has prescribed Voltarol suppositories 12.5mg for your child. This leaflet contains important information about the suppositories. Please read it carefully before your child starts using them.     What’s in the suppositories   Voltarol suppositories contain diclofenac sodium. This is one of a group of medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics. The suppositories contain 12.5mg of diclofenac sodium in a hard, fatty suppository base.   The suppositories do not contain any animal extracts.   Voltarol suppositories 12.5mg come in packs of 10.   Made by Ciba-Geigy Limited, Stein, Switzerland.   Product Licence holder: Ciba-Geigy plc, Hulley Road, Macclesfield Cheshire.     What these suppositories are used for   Voltarol suppositories 12.5mg are used to treat arthritis in children. Doctors sometimes prescribe Voltarol suppositories for other purposes; ask your doctor for information .     Before using the suppositories   Talk to your doctor before using the suppositories if your child:     Has had any disease causing ulceration of the stomach or duodenum.     Has had an allergic reaction, skin rash or wheezing after taking aspirin or any other medicine used to treat painful conditions.     Suffers from any gut disorders, for example, ulcerative or inflammatory disease of the bowel, rectum (back passage) or anus.     Also tell your doctor if your child:     Has experienced stomach discomfort, felt like being sick or had heartburn after taking aspirin or any other medicine used to treat painful conditions.     Suffers from any heart, kidney or liver disease.     Is taking:     steroid tablets.     any medicines for heart conditions.     methotrexate.     any other medicines which your doctor does not know about.     Pregnancy information if relevant can be obtained from your doctor.     Other special warnings     Suppositories are designed for insertion into the back passage (rectum).   They must never be taken by mouth.      Whilst your child is using Voltarol suppositories, your doctor may want to give them a check-up from time to time.     Voltarol suppositories 12.5mg are not suitable for children under the age of 1 year.       Using the suppositories   It is important that you follow your doctor’s instructions about when to give your child their suppositories. Read the label on the box carefully: it will tell you when to use them. The usual dose is one suppository inserted two or three times each day, but this will vary according to the age of your child.   If you are not sure about the dose check with your doctor or pharmacist.     Inserting a suppository     If your child needs to empty their bowels, make sure they do so before you give them a suppository.     Get your child to lie on their front or side.         Wash your hands and then tear the foil wrapping apart at the notch and take out the suppository.         Gently push the suppository pointed end first into your child’s back passage (rectum) until it disappears.     Try to stop your child moving around for a few minutes. It is important to keep the suppository in the rectum to allow it to melt and the medicine to be absorbed.     Wash your hands.      Date of preparation: February 1994      After using the suppositories   Voltarol suppositories do not usually cause problems. However, they can sometimes cause unwanted effects in some people.   If your child gets any of the following:      Stomach pain, indigestion, heartburn or feeling sick for the first time.     Any sign of bleeding in the stomach or intestine, for example passing black stools.     Skin rash, itching or bruising.     A sudden attack of wheezing or shortness of breath.     Yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes.     Persistent sore throat or high temperature.     An unexpected change in the amount of urine produced and/or its appearance.      STOP using the suppositories and tell your doctor.    Other effects which are unusual but which may occur include:     Itching or burning in the back passage.     Headache, dizziness or tiredness.     Very rarely, these suppositories can have other effects on the nervous system causing, for example, sleeplessness or tinnitus (ringing in the ears).   These effects are often mild and may wear off after a few days’ treatment. If they are severe or last for more than a few days, tell your doctor. Also, if the suppositories upset your child in any other way, tell your doctor.     Storing the suppositories     The expiry date for these suppositories is given on the box. Do not use the suppositories after this date.     Keep the suppositories in a cool place out of reach of children. Return any unused suppositories to your pharmacist.      REMEMBER:   this medicine is for your child. Only a doctor can prescribe it. Never give it to someone else. It may harm them even if they have the same symptoms as your child.

Directions for use   Oestrogel should be used as directed by your doctor. For topical use only.   If you are still having regular periods you should begin Oestrogel medication within 5 days of the start  of bleeding. If your periods have stopped, or are irregular, you can start Oestrogel medication at any time. Oestrogel may be applied once daily either in the morning or evening after washing, but preferably about the same time each day. If your doctor has prescribed 2 measures of gel, you will need one measure spread over each arm and shoulder, or each inner thigh. If 4 measures of gel have been prescribed you will need 2 measures on each arm and shoulder or inner thigh.     The template   You have been provided with a template which when placed on the skin of the shoulder/arm or inner thigh will show you the minimum area of skin over which to spread Oestrogel.      The dispenser   You have been provided with a dispenser   (1)  ; take the plastic cap off the dispenser. Underneath the plastic cap is a plunger which can be pressed down to measure out the correct amount of gel. A safety lock stops the plunger from being pressed down when it is not in use   (2)  . To release this safety lock - turn the plunger until the notch on the transparent band beneath the plunger is in line with the spout   (3)  . The plunger is now free to move downwards and the dispenser is ready to use.     Make sure that your hands and the skin of the area of application are clean, dry and unbroken.     Open the template and place in position on arm/shoulder or inner thigh; the template is a guide - you should spread the gel over an area at least the size of the template.     Remove the template, hold the dispenser inclined in one hand, and place the other hand over the spout to collect the gel. With the index finger or thumb press the plunger down firmly, and continue to press for   two seconds (4)  . Release the pressure; the amount of Oestrogel which flows out of the spout is one measure (1.25 g )   (5).       Apply one or two measures of Oestrogel to the skin and spread over an area at least as big as the template.     Transfer the template to the other arm/shoulder or thigh to outline the correct area.     Apply one or two measures of Oestrogel to the skin and spread over an area at least as big as the template.      After use turn the dosing head   (6)   so that the   notch is no longer in line with the spout   (7). Do not forget to replace the plastic cap (8).       N.B.   If on release of pressure the dosing head does not spring up to its initial position, this means that the dispenser is nearly empty and should no longer be used.   Do NOT apply on or near the breasts, or on the genital region.   Leave to dry for 5 minutes before covering with clothes.     Progestogen tablets:   Unless you have had a hysterectomy, your doctor will have prescribed a progestogen tablet to be taken while receiving Oestrogel medication . Take the tablets as instructed by your doctor. It is best to take the tablet either just before or just after applying Oestrogel. While you are using both Oestrogel and a progestogen you may have a period towards the end of the treatment with progestogen tablets, this is quite normal. You may find it helpful to tick off each day on the enclosed calendar. This will assist you in keeping a record of your medication and remind you when the next course of tablets is due.    Side effects   Your doctor will arrange for a complete physical and gynaecological examination before treatment and for regular check-ups while you are using Oestrogel, this is normal practice for patients receiving hormone  replacement therapy. Oestrogel may cause unwanted effects in some people such as:     headaches, migraine, nausea, breast tenderness, secretion or enlargement, mood changes, increased cervical mucus and increase in size of uterine fibroids.     irritation or reddening of the skin at the site of application.     If these or any other unwanted effects occur with any severity you should consult your doctor.     Use by date   Do not use after the expiry date shown on the carton and dispenser. The dispenser will provide at least 64 full measures of 1.25 9. If using 2 measures a day, start a new dispenser at the beginning of each month. If using 4 measures a day you will need to start a new dispenser after 2 weeks.     Storage conditions   The dispenser should be stored away from heat (at a temperature of less than 25ºC). Like all pressurised containers, the dispenser should neither be pierced nor placed in a fire, even when empty. If you need further information about the use of Oestrogel please ask your doctor or pharmacist.

IMPORTANT:   Diabetic patients may be unconscious because they have   too much   sugar in the blood (hyperglycaemia) as well as from a 'hypo' In this case Glucagon will not work Get medical help at once      Please read the back of this leaflet          What you should know about Glucagon for Injection BP - continued         Using Glucagon   Do not make up your Glucagon Injection until you are going to use it.     Preparing the injection     Take the seals off the Glucagon and diluent bottles (numbers 1 and 2). (Figure 1) Wipe the rubber stoppers with an alcohol swab. Use a sterile U100/1ml insulin syringe and needle.     Take the needle cover off and draw air into the syringe up to the 50-unit mark. (Figure 2)     Holding the syringe as shown in Figure 3, put the needle into the middle of the stopper of the diluent bottle (number 1).     Turn the bottle upside down and slowly inject air from the syringe into the bottle. This makes it easier to draw out the diluent (Figure 4)     Keep the tip of the needle in the diluent and draw all the liquid up into the syringe. (Figure 4)     Take the needle out of bottle number 1 and put the same syringe and needle into the bottle with the green stripe (number 2). Inject all the liquid already in the syringe into bottle number 2. (Glucagon). (Figure 5)     Remove the needle. Shake the bottle gently until the Glucagon powder dissolves and the solution is clear. (Figure 6)      Do not inject Glucagon unless the solution is clear and looks like water.      .       Injecting Glucagon     Using the same syringe and needle, draw all the solution out of bottle number 2. (Figure 7)     Using an alcohol swab, clean an injection site on your buttock, arm or thigh     Put the needle into the clean skin and inject the Glucagon solution. Press the injection site lightly with cotton wool and then remove the needle from the injection site.       If the patient is unconscious, turn them to lie on their side.     If the patient is a small child,(weighing less than 20 kilograms) use half the mixed dose of Glucagon (0.5 unit).      Measure the blood glucose after you have injected a dose of Glucagon. Give the patient something sugary to eat or drink as soon as he or she wakes up and can swallow. Call a doctor. If the patient does not wake up within about 15 minutes, inject another dose of Glucagon and call an ambulance  at once.         While using Glucagon   Glucagon does not usually cause side-effects except for occasional nausea or vomiting. (The 'hypo' can also cause nausea or vomiting.) So that the patient does not choke on the vomit, make sure that they are Iying on their side before and when they wake up.   A few patients have reported an allergic reaction to Glucagon, including skin rash, breathlessness and dizziness. You may also have diarrhoea or low levels of potassium in your blood. Tell your doctor if you have any problems when you use Glucagon. He or she has more information about Glucagon and can tell you what to do.       How to store Glucagon for Injection BP   Do not inject the Glucagon after the 'Use Before' date. Keep your medicine in a safe place where children cannot see or reach it. Do not let it get hot (over 25°C). Throw away any solution you do not use once the bottles have been mixed.   REMEMBER: This medicine is for you. Never give it to others. It may harm them, even if their symptoms are the same as yours.   Date of leaflet preparation: May 1994 © Eli Lilly and Company Ltd., 1994.     ",

ABOUT YOUR MEDICINE   Diltiazem belongs to a group of medicines called calcium-channel blockers. It is used for treating high blood pressure and the chest pain called angina.     BEFORE TAKING YOUR MEDICINE     Are you pregnant or may become pregnant, or are you breast-feeding?     Have you taken ANGITIL SR Capsules before or any medicines containing diltiazem or other calcium-channel blockers (e.g nifedipine, verapamil) before and had an allergic reaction (rash, itching, shortness of breath)?     Do you suffer from heart disease (e.g heart failure, a slow heart rate) or have you recently had a heart attack?     Are you taking '‘Beta-blocker' medication (for high blood pressure, angina, palpitations or nervousness)   AND   you have been told that you suffer from an interference with normal heartbeat?     If the answer to any of these questions is YES, DO NOT TAKE the capsules without consulting your doctor again.     Do you suffer from muscles which are rigid or go into spasm and you perhaps take a medicine called dantrolene for the condition?     If the answer to this question is YES then if you go into hospital for severe spasm of your muscles you   must   tell the doctor that you are taking diltiazem. If dantrolene is given by injection it can seriously interfere with diltiazem.     Are you taking anti-arrhythmic medicines such as digoxin (for the treatment of palpitations or irregular heart beat), carbamazepine (for epilepsy), cyclosporin (for the treatment of psoriasis or to prevent rejection of an organ following a transplant), theophylline (for asthma or other breathing difficulties) or anti-ulcer drugs (for the treatment of stomach ulcers)?     Are you taking other anti-hypertensive medicines (for the treatment of high blood pressure) such as '‘Beta-blockers' (e.g propranolol) or 'Alpha-blockers' (e.g prazosin)? Prazosin and other 'Alpha-blockers' are also used to treat a condition where the toes and fingers become very cold (Raynaud's disease).     It is best to let your doctor know if you are taking any other medicines, including ones you have bought yourself without a prescription.     Do you have kidney or liver disease?     Do you suffer from porphyria?     If the answer to any of these questions is YES, tell your doctor or pharmacist.   If you have an operation, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking ANGITIL SR Capsules and the dose that you are taking   If you have any blood, urine or other tests - tell the doctor or medical staff that you are taking diltiazem because the medicine can interfere with the result.   If your doctor prescribes you to take ANGITIL SR Capsules together with another antihypertensive medicine (e.g a 'Beta-blocker', a water tablet, an ACE-inhibitor, an 'Alphablocker') it is likely that your condition will be monitored regularly.     HOW TO TAKE YOUR MEDICINE    Make sure you take the capsules exactly as directed by your doctor.    The usual dose of ANGITIL SR Capsules for the treatment of angina or high blood pressure is 90 mg to be taken twice a day. Over a period of time, your doctor may increase your dose to 120 mg twice a day, or 180 mg to be taken twice a day.   If you are elderly or you suffer from liver or kidney disease your doctor is likely to prescribe you a low dose of diltiazem. You may previously have been prescribed diltiazem 60 mg tablets. Your doctor may very gradually increase your dose and is likely to check your condition regularly to start with.    BE SURE TO PAY CAREFUL ATTENTION TO YOUR DOCTOR'S ADVICE ON WHICH STRENGTH, AND HOW MANY, CAPSULES YOU NEED TO TAKE.    Exactly how many capsules, which strength, and how often you must take them, will be written on the label.   Please read the label carefully.    Swallow the capsules whole with a drink of water. Do not chew them.   You should finish all the capsules your doctor has prescribed. Even if you feel better, you should still take all the capsules you have been given - it may be dangerous to stop taking the medicine without your doctor's advice.   If you forget to take a dose, take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is nearly time to take the next one. Never take two doses together. Take the remaining capsules at the correct times.   If you see another doctor or go into hospital, tell them what medicines you are taking     WHAT TO DO IF AN OVERDOSE IS TAKEN   If you (or someone else) swallows a lot of the capsules all together, or if you think a child has swallowed any of the capsules, contact your nearest hospital casualty department or doctor immediately.     AFTER TAKING YOUR MEDICINE   If you develop wheezing or shortness of breath or severe skin rashes or itching after taking ANGITIL SR Capsules for the first time,   STOP   taking the capsules and tell your doctor   immediately  .   Tell your doctor   as soon as possible   if you develop a change in your normal heartbeat (eg slowing of heart rate, which may cause you to become dizzy, feel faint or actually faint). More common side-effects which some people get include swelling of the legs and ankles headaches, stomach upsets, feeling of sickness, tiredness, flushing and milder skin rashes. Tell your doctor if you suffer badly from any of these side-effects.   Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice any other unwanted effects not mentioned above.     STORING YOUR MEDICINE   Do not take any capsules after the expiry date printed on the container. If you have any medicines which are out of date, return them to your pharmacist for disposal.   Keep your capsules in a safe place where children cannot reach them.   These capsules should be stored in a dry place. Keep them in the pack they came in. DO not transfer them to another container.   DO not keep any capsules you no longer need; give them back to your pharmacist for disposal.     FURTHER INFORMATION   Remember, this medicine is only for you. Only a doctor can prescribe it for you.

"      Triludan Forte Tablets Terfenadine   Please read this leaflet carefully before you start to take your medicine. If you are not sure about anything or have any questions ask your pharmacist or doctor.    What is in your medicine?   The name of your medicine is Triludan Forte tablets. Each tablet contains 120 mg of the active ingredient terfenadine. The tablets contain no dyes or preservatives. The other ingredients are maize starch, lactose, gelatin, sodium bicarbonate and magnesium stearate.   Each pack contains 30 or 7 tablets. The tablets are white convex, capsule-shaped with an inscribed 'T', 'F' and breakline on one side.     What you should know about Triludan Forte tablets   Terfenadine is one of a group of medicines called antihistamines. Antihistamines relieve the symptoms of hayfever, perennial rhinitis and some allergic skin conditions.   The product licence for Triludan Forte tablets is held by: Marion Merrell Ltd, Broadwater Park, Denham, Uxbridge, Middlesex, UB9 5HP.   The manufacturers are Marion Merrell SA, Boulevard de Champarey, 38317 Bourgoin-Jallieu, France; Gruppo Lepetit SpA, Localita Valcanello, Casella Postale N46, 03012, Anagni, Italy.     What are Triludan Forte tablets for?   Triludan Forte is an antihistamine. Antihistamines relieve the symptoms such as sneezing, watery eyes, blocked or runny nose, that occur with hayfever (seasonal allergic rhinitis) and a similar condition called perennial rhinitis that continues throughout the year.   They also relieve the redness, swelling and itching of some allergic skin complaints including nettle rash and reactions to insect bites and stings.    When should you   not   take Triludan Forte tablets    In some circumstances it is very important not to take Triludan Forte and these are listed below. If you ignore these instructions, this medicine could affect your heart rhythm.     Do not take Triludan Forte if you are taking:     ketoconazole by mouth or itraconazole (medicines for fungus infections)     erythromycin (an antibiotic)     These will have been prescribed for you by a doctor and sometimes are known by other names.

"    PRIIVL4GORe   injection   Presentation: Primacor Injection is available as a sterile, clear, colourless to pale yellow solution, in 10ml ampoules (containing 10mg milrinone as the lactate) for intravenous administration. Primacor also contains dextrose and lactic acid.   Uses: Primacor Injection is indicated for the short-term treatment of severe congestive heart failure unresponsive to conventional maintenance therapy and for the treatment of acute heart failure, including low output states, following cardiac surgery.   Action: Milrinone is a positive inotrope and vasodilator, with little chronotropic activity. It also improves left ventricular diastolic relaxation. It differs in structure and mode of action from the digitalis glycosides, catecholamines or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. It is a selective inhibitor of peak lil phosphodiesterase isoenzyme in cardiac and vascular muscle. It produces slight enhancement of A-V node conduction, but no other significant electrophysiological effects. In clinical studies Primacor Injection has been shown to produce prompt improvements in the haemodynamic indices of heart failure, including cardiac output, pulmonary capiilary wedge pressure and vascular resistance, without clinically significant effect on heart rate or myocardial oxygen consumption. These improvements are related to both dose and plasma concentration. Haemodynamic improvement during intravenous Primacor therapy in chronic heart failure is accompanied by clinical symptomatic improvement, as measured by changes in New York Heart Association classification.   Dosage and Administration: For intravenous administration.   Adults: Primacor Injection should be given as a loading dose of 50 microgrammes/kg administered over a period of 10 minutes followed by continuous maintenance infusion at a dosage titrated between 0.375 microgrammes/kg/min and 0.75 microgrammes/kg/min to give a maximum haemodynamic effect. Total dosage should not exceed 1.13mg/kg/day.   Note: In impaired renal function, lower rates of maintenance infusion are advised; see ""Use in Impaired Renal Function"".     .      PRIMACOR INJECTION Dose (microgrammes/kg/min)   0.375 0.400 0.500 0.600 0.700 0.750 MAINTENANCE INFUSION DELIVERY RATE (ml/kghrr) O.t1 O.t2 0.15 0.18 0.21 0.22 _ ~A 200 microgrammes/ml solution is prepared by using 40ml diluent per 10ml ampoule Primacor Injection.      0.45% saline, 0.9% saline or 5% dextrose may be used as diluents. Solutions of different concentrations may be used according to patient fluid requirements. The duration of therapy should depend upon the patient's response. In chronic heart failure, patients have been maintained on treatment for several days although the usual period is 48 to 72 hours. In acute states following cardiac surgery it is unlikely that treatment need be maintained for more than 12 hours.    Use in Impaired Renal Function: Data obtained from patients with severe renal impaimment but without congestive heart failure have demonstrated that the presence of renal impairment significantly increases the terminal elimination half-life of milrinone. For patients with clinical evidence of renal impairment, the following maintenance infusion rates are recommended:   CreatininePrimacor Injection clearancedose (ml/min/1.73m2)(microgrammes/ kg/min)) 5 10 20 30 40 50 0.20 0.23 0.28 0.33 0.38 0.43   Maintenance infusion delivery rate (for solution of milrinone 200 microgrammes/ml) (ml/kg/hr) 0.06 0.07 0.08 0.10 0.11 0.13   Adjustment of the infusion rate should be made according to haemodynamic response.    Use in Elderly Patients:   Experience so far suggests that no special recommendations for the elderly patient are necessary.    Use in Children:   Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.    Contra-indications, Warnings, etc.:    Contra-indications: Hypersensitivity to Primacor Injection is a contra-indication to its use.    Precautions:   The use of Primacor Injection is not recommended immediately following acute myocardial infarction until safety and efficacy have been established in this situation.   In patients with severe obstructive aortic or pulmonary valvular disease or hypertrophic subaortic stenosis, Primacor Injection should not be used in place of surgical relief of the obstruction. In these conditions it is possible that a drug with inotropic/vasodilator properties might aggravate outflow obstruction .   As milrinone produces a slight enhancement in A-V node conduction, Primacor Injection may increase ventricular response rate in patients with uncontrolled atrial flutter/fibrillation. In these patients, prior digitalisation or treatment with other     agents to prolong A-V node conduction time should be considered.   Milrinone may induce hypotension through its vasodilatory actions. Particular caution should therefore be observed when initiating Primacor Injection therapy in patients who are hypotensive and in those in whom prior vigorous diuretic therapy is suspected of causing significant decreases in cardiac filling pressure. Blood pressure, heart rate, electrocardiogram, clinical state, fluid balance, electrolytes and renal function should be carefully monitored when initiabng and during Primacor Injection therapy. The infusion should be sbwed or stopped if arrhythmias develop or an excessive decrease in blood pressure occurs. Improvement in cardiac output with resultant diuresis may necessitate a reduction in the dose of diuretic. Potassium loss due to excessive diuresis may predispose digitalised patents to arrhythmias. Therefore, hypokalaemia should be corrected by potassium supplementation in advance of, or during, the use of Primacor Injection.   Use in Pregnancy and Lactation: Although animal studies have not revealed evidence of druginduced foetal damage or other deleterious effects on reproductive function, the safety of milrinone in human pregnancy has not yet been established. It should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. Caution should be exercised when Primacor Injection is administered to nursing women, since it is not known whether milrinone is excreted in human milk.   side Effects: Supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias including nonsustained ventricular tachycardia have been reported during treatment with Primacor Injection. An increase in ventricular response rate in patients with atrial fibrillation may occur. The incidence of arrhythmias has not been related to dose or plasma levels of milrinone. Other reported side-effects include hypotension, angina/chest pain, headaches, hypokalaemia and tremor. Thrombocytopenia has also been observed but has not been definitely related to the administrabon of Primacor Injection.   Drug Interactions: No untoward clinical manifestations of drug interaction have been observed during Primacor Injection therapy. Whilst there is a theoretical potential interaction with calcium channel blockers, there has been no evidence of a clinically significant interaction to date. Milrinone has a favourable inotropic effect in fully digitalised patients without causing signs of glycoside toxicity.   Chemical Compatibility: Precipitabon occurs immediately when frusemide or bumetanide is mixed with milrinone solution. Therefore, frusemide or bumetanide should not be administered in intravenous lines containing Primacor Injection. Sodium bicarbonate intravenous infusion should not be used for dilution. Other drugs should not be mixed with Primacor Injection until further compatibility data are available.   Overdosage: Overdoses of intravenous Primacor Injection may produce hypotension because of the vasodilatory effect. No specific     antidote is known, but general measures for circulatory support should be taken.   Pharmaceutical Precautions: Store at room temperature; avoid freezing. Infusion solutions diluted as recommended with 0.45% saline,0.9% saline or 5% dextrose should be freshly prepared before use. Parenteral drug products should be examined visually and should not be used if particulate matter or discolouration are present.   Legal Category: POM.   Package Quantities: Boxes of 10 ampoules.   Further Information: In congestive heart failure, milrinone on intravenous administration has a volume of distribution of about 0.4 I/kg, a temminal elimination haH-life of about 2.3 hours and a clearance of about 0.13 I/kg/h. These pharmacokinetic parameters are not dose-dependent. Milrinone is approximately 70% bound to plasma protein and is primarily excreted unchanged via the kidney.   @ Registered Trade Mark.

"      Kliofem   Continuous combined HRT Please read the whole leaflet carefully before you start to take your Kliofem    What's in your medicine   Kliofem is supplied in a calendar dial pack of 28 yellow tablets, each containing 2 milligrams of oestradiol (an oestrogen) and 1 milligram of norethisterone acetate (a progestogen). So each tablet combines oestrogen and progestogen, and the same tablets are taken continuously.   The tablets also contain lactose, maize starch, gelatin, talc, magnesium stearate, E464, E 171, E 172 and propylene glycol. The tablets do not contain any significant amounts of gluten.   Kliofem is one of a group of hormone replacement therapies called continuous combined H RT.    Product licence holder:   Novo Nordisk Pharmaceuticals Limited, Novo Nordisk House, Broadfield Park, Brighton Road, Pease Pottage, Crawley, West Sussex RH11 9RT. Tel: (01293) 613555.    Manufacturer:   Novo Nordisk A/S, Novo Alle, DK2880 Bagsvaerd, Denmark.     About Kliofem and Hormone Replacement Therapy   Your doctor has prescribed Kliofem to relieve the unpleasant symptoms (such as hot flushes) which occur in many women around the time of the menopause. Kliofem may also have been prescribed to prevent the bone loss which can occur at this time, and which in some women can lead to fractures of the wrist, spine or hip in later life.   Many women have been put off HRT, because most types cause a return of regular monthly periods. Kliofem does not cause a regular monthly period. After a 3-4 months settling in period, the majority of women have no bleeding or only occasional spotting. Bleeding or spotting does often occur in the first few months until the treatment settles down.     Important questions before taking Kliofem     Have you had cancer of the breast or endometrium (lining of the womb)?     Do you have, or are you being treated for phlebitis (inflamed veins), DVT (deep vein thrombosis), blood clot in the leg or stroke?     Have you recently had any vaginal bleeding, other than during a period?     Do you suffer from liver problems, for example jaundice?     Do you suffer from heart or kidney disease?     Are you pregnant?     Are you allergic to any of the constituents? (these are listed above).     If you have answered Yes to any of these questions, tell your doctor or pharmacist before starting Kliofem.     Precautions   Kliofem must be stopped at once if you become pregnant.   Ask your doctor for advice on whether you should stop taking the tablets if you need an operation or if you are confined to bed for prolonged periods.   Your doctor will measure your blood pressure and carry out gynaecological and breast examinations at regular intervals, as appropriate for you.   It has been established that taking oestrogens alone increases the risk of endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the womb). Taking a progestogen in addition to the oestrogen lowers the increased risk.   Fibroids of the womb may increase in size during treatment. Tell your doctor if you notice any abdominal swelling whilst you are taking Kliofem.   If you suffer from endometriosis, discuss this with your doctor since the symptoms may be worsened by H RT.   There has been concern about the possible risk of breast cancer with oestrogen treatment. Many studies have not shown any increase in breast cancer, but some  have shown a small increase after prolonged treatment (5 years or longer). During treatment with Kliofem you should regularly self-examine your breasts. Your doctor will advise you if you need regular mammography; this may be necessary if you have, or have had, breast nodules or fibrocystic disease.   The risk of thrombosis (blood clot) is not known to be increased during treatment with Kliofem. However if a blood clot occurs during treatment, Kliofem should be stopped. You should stop taking the tablets and see your doctor if you experience any of the following: unusually severe or frequent headache, sudden visual disturbance, inflamed veins, pain in the chest, swelling in the legs or arms, breathlessness, pain on breathing.   The oestrogens in HRT may increase the risk of gallstones.   You should stop taking Kliofem if you develop jaundice during treatment.   Kliofem has little effect on blood pressure. If you have high blood pressure before starting Kliofem your doctor may want to measure your blood pressure more frequently. If you develop high blood pressure after starting Kliofem, you should stop taking the tablets.   If you have a blood test, remember to tell the doctor that you are taking Kliofem, since it may affect the result.     Kliofem and other diseases   Certain diseases are known to sometimes worsen during HRT, and this can occasionally happen during treatment with Kliofem. If you suffer from otosclerosis (loss of hearing sometimes associated with pregnancy), multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, porphyria, melanoma (skin cancer), epilepsy, migraine, asthma, heart or kidney disease you will require more careful monitoring and your doctor may wish to see you more frequently.   If you have diabetes, your diabetes control may alter when you first start Kliofem - monitor your blood glucose more frequently during this time.     Contraception   It is important to note that Kliofem is not an oral contraceptive. If you are taking non-hormonal contraceptive precautions when you start Kliofem, you should continue to do so until your doctor tells you that contraceptive precautions are no longer required. If you have been taking a hormonal contraceptive (i.e. the 'pill' or depot injections) you must change to a non-hormonal form of contraception before starting Kliofem.   If your doctor has already told you that you no longer need to take contraceptive precautions you need not do so whilst taking Kliofem.     Taking your Kliofem   If you are not currently taking HRT you can start taking Kliofem immediately.   If you are currently taking another HRT, continue taking it until the end of your monthly bleed (if you have one) then start Kliofem.   Take one tablet a day, preferably at about the same time. Swallow it whole.     The first tablet to be taken is under the sealed opening in the transparent outer rim of the calendar dial pack. Use your thumbnail to break the clear plastic tab, tip out your first tablet, and swallow it whole.      Now use a coin on the white centre to set the right day of the week against the empty space. You only need to do this once. If, at any time, you think you might have   During the first few months of Kliofem treatment you may experience some bleeding or spotting - this is seen       ",
"      WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT SANDIMMUN (Cyclosporin) SOFT GELATIN CAPSULES   Please read this leaflet carefully before you start to take this medicine, even if you have taken   SANDIMMUN   Soft Gelatin Capsules before. You will notice that the advice contained in this leaflet may vary depending on whether you are receiving the drug for transplantation or taking it for your skin condition or as  treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. If you have any questions or are unsure about anything, ask your doctor or pharmacist (chemist) for advice.    WHAT'S IN YOUR MEDICINE   SANDIMMUN Soft Gelatin Capsules contain cyclosporin.    The capsules are available in 3 strengths. They contain either     25mg cyclosporin (Pale-pink in colour)     50mg cyclosporin (Corn-yellow in colour)     100mg cyclospmin (Dusky-pink in colour)     All three capsule strengths contain the following inactive ingredients: Maize oil, titanium dioxide (E171), glycerol, sorbitol syrup gelatin and absolute ethanol.   The 25mg and 100mg capsules also contain iron oxide red (E172) The 50mg capsules also contain iron oxide yellow (E172)   Packs contain 30 capsules.   The name of your medicine is   SANDIMMUN   and it contains cyclosporin. It is one of a group of drugs known as immunosuppressive agents. These drugs are used to dampen down the body’s immune reactions.    SANDIMMUN   Soft Gelatin Capsules are manufactured for: by: RP Scherer GmbH SANDOZ PHARMACEUTICALSGammelsbacher Strasse 2 SANDOZ Pharmaceuticals (UK) LtdD-69412 Eberbach Frimley Business ParkGermany Frimley Camberley Surrey GU16 5SG    WHY DOES YOUR DOCTOR WANT YOU TO USE SANDIMMUN SOFT GELATIN CAPSULES?       If you have received an organ or bone marrow transplant   Although you may have undergone a series of tests before your organ or bone marrow transplant to ensure that the match between your body and the transplanted organ or bone marrow was as close as possible, the donor tissue will still not be identical to your tissue. As a result, your body’s immune system will try to reject the donor tissue.   SANDIMMUN   helps to stop this rejection response by blocking the development of special cells which would normally attack the transplanted tissue.     If you have a severe skin complaint   Some skin conditions, such as severe psoriasis or eczema (atopic dermatitis) are thought to be caused by your immune system over-reacting.    SANDIMMUN   may help to stop this by suppressing the immune system, thereby improving your skin condition.      If you have severe rheumatoid arthritis   It is thought that rheumatoid arthritis may be caused by inappropriate immune responses in your body.   SANDIMMUN   may help to stop this by suppressing your immune system, thereby improving your rheumatoid arthritis.     BEFORE USING YOUR MEDICINE   Tell your doctor before you start taking   SANDIMMUN   Soft Gelatin capsules if the answer to any of the following questions is yes:     Do you suspect that you have had an allergic reaction to, or been upset by any oi the ingredients in   SANDIMMUN   (listed in ‘What’s in your Medicine’)?     Do you have any kidney problems or have you had any disease which may have affected your kidneys?     Do you have high blood pressure?     Do you have an infection of any type?     Have you been told that you have any kind of tumour?     Do you have any liver problems or have you had any disease which may have affected your liver?     Have you been told that you have high levels of potassium in your blood or that you have gout?     Do you have any skin conditions other than severe psoriasis or severe eczema?     Are you taking any other medicines (either bought or prescribed)?     Some medicines can interfere with your treatment so make sure to check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking any other medicines. In particular, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following:     antibiotics or antifungal medicines for treatment of infection     oral contraceptive tablets     any medicines for heart problems or high blood pressure     anti-epileptic medicines     cholesterol lowering medicines      other immunosuppressive medicines (eg. prednisolone)     sleeping tablets     potassium supplements      medicines to encourage urination     anti-inflammatory medicines (eg. diclofenac)     light treatment for a skin condition     colchicine     Are you pregnant or planning to become pregnant? If you do become pregnant whilst taking   SANDIMMUN  , tell your doctor.     Are you breast feeding?     Have you recently received any vaccinations or are you planning to have any vaccinations?     Are you likely to be exposed to the sun a great deal without protecting your skin with a sun block cream?     Do you regularly use a sun bed?     Has the medicine been prescribed for the treatment of eczema in someone who is less than 16 years of age?     Has the medicine been prescribed for the treatment of severe rheumatoid arthritis in someone who is less than 18 years of age?         TAKING YOUR MEDICINE   Your doctor will work out the correct dose of   SANDIMMUN   for you depending on your body weight and whether you are taking   SANDIMMUN   following a transplant or as a treatment for severe psoriasis, eczema or rheumatoid arthritis. Your doctor will also tell you how often to take your medicine.   If you have had an organ or bone marrow transplant the total dose is usually within the range of 2mg/kg body weight per day and 15mg/kg body weight per day. Generally, the higher doses are used just age transplantation and the lower doses are used once your transplanted organ or bane marrow has stabilised. Your doctor will adjust your dose to one that is ideal for you. To do this he may need to do some blood tests.   For the treatment of severe psoriasis and eczema the total dose is usually within the range of 2.5mg/kg body weight per day and 5mg/kg body weight per day.   For the treatment of severe rheumatoid arthritis, the total daily dose is usually within the range of 2.5mg/kg body weight per day and 4mg/kg body weight per day.   Your doctor will tell you how much   SANDIMMUN   to take and how long you will need to take   SANDIMMUN,   depending on whether you are taking it following transplantation or for the treatment of a severe skin condition or rheumatoid arthritis. For the treatment of severe eczema, treatment usually lasts for 8 weeks.   Follow your doctor’s instructions exactly and never change the dose yourself, however well you feel.   Do not stop taking your medicine unless your doctor tells you to, however well you feel.   Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure about how much medicine to take or when to take it.      AFTER TAKING YOUR MEDICINE   Most people benefit from taking this medicine, but a few people can be upset by it.   The dose of this medicine needs to be carefully adjusted by your doctor. Too much can affect the kidneys. You will, therefore, have regular blood tests and visits to the hospital, particularly after transplantation. Your blood pressure will also be measured regularly. These visits will give you the chance to talk to your doctor about your treatment and mention any problems you are having.   If you develop a sore throat, any infections or begin to feel generally unwell see your doctor immediately.   Side-effects that have sometimes been reported in patients taking   SANDIMMUN   include shakiness of the hands, upset stomach or abdominal pain, altered bowel habit, swollen gums, increased growth of hair on the body or face, high blood pressure, liver problems, tiredness and sensations of heat in the hands and feet.   More rarely, headaches, skin rash, increased weight, fluid retention, confusion, feelings of numbness or tingling, muscle weakness or cramps, fits, gout, raised cholesterol levels, slight swelling of the breast tissue, changes in the menstrual period in women and tumours have also been reported.   In liver transplant patients vision and movement disturbances, and loss of concentration have also been reported as side-effects. However, although these effects have been reported in patients taking   SANDIMMUN  ,   they may not have actually been due to the medicine.   Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you suffer from any of these effects, or from any other side-effects not mentioned in this leaflet        Remove the capsule from the foil as shown in the picture        STORING YOUR MEDICINE   Leave your capsules in the foil.

Hydrocortone Tablets are made by Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited, Shotton Lane, Cramlington Northumberland, for Merck Sharp & Dohme limited, Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, UK, who hold the Product Licence in the UK.     Why do you need to take these tablets?   Your doctor has prescribed Hydrocortone for you because you have a condition known as adrenocortical insufficiency. The adrenal cortex, part of the adrenal glands situated near the kidneys, produces hormones called corticosteroids. Your adrenal cortex is not producing sufficient amounts of these corticosteroids to keep your body working properly. The hydrocortisone in your tablets replaces the natural steroids that you lack and helps to keep you healthy.     Are there some people who should not take hydrocortone?   Yes, do not take the tablets if:     You are or think you may be pregnant.     You are planning to become pregnant.     You are breast-feeding.     You have an infection which could have been caused by a fungus (e.g. thrush).     You have had a bad reaction to this or similar medicines in the past.

You have suffered from muscle weakness with this     or other steroids in the past.     You have an eye infection with the herpes virus.     You should see your doctor if you develop any new infections while taking these tablets.   If the patient is a child, it is important that the doctor  monitors growth and development at intervals during treatment.   If you have an accident, fall ill, require any surgery (including at the dentist's), during or after treatment with Hydrocortone, you must tell the doctor treating you that you are taking or have taken steroids.   IMPORTANT: All patients taking steroid drugs for more than a few days should carry 'steroid treatment' cards, which are available from your pharmacist. These cards carry details of your medicine and your doctor.   Hydrocortone contains lactose as an inactive ingredient and may produce symptoms in lactose-intolerant individuals.     Can you take Hydrocortone with other medicines?   Some other medicines do not mix with Hydrocortone. Your doctor is aware of these and will alter your treatment as necessary. However, it is very important that you tell your doctor about all the medicines you are taking, including those obtained without a doctor's prescription.   If you are taking any of the following medicines you should talk to your doctor before taking Hydrocortone.     Aspirin.     Phenytoin (used to treat epilepsy).

"      Cilest    Oral Contraceptive Tablets    Why you should read this leaflet   This leaflet contains important information about your Cilest pills.   Please read it carefully before you start taking Cilest. If you have any questions about what is written here or wish for any further information please ask either your doctor, nurse or pharmacist (chemist).     How does your body get ready for pregnancy?   You are able to become pregnant throughout your fertile years, that is to say from the time when you start to have menstrual periods until you reach the age when your periods stop (usually your late 40s).   The time between the beginning of one menstrual period and the next is called the menstrual cycle. It lasts about 28 days. In the middle of the menstrual cycle one of the ovaries releases an egg into a Fallopian tube (see picture)- this is called ovulation. The egg moves down the Fallopian tube towards the womb.    The egg will then either be fertilised by one sperm (conception) or discarded with the lining of the womb (menstrual period).   For the egg to be fertilised, it must encounter a sperm in the Fallopian tube. When you have sex, your partner releases millions of sperms into your vagina; some of the sperms travel up through the womb into the Fallopian tubes.   If there is an egg in a Fallopian tube, one sperm will fertilise it. The fertilised egg will move towards the womb, become implanted in the lining and start growing into a baby.   If the egg does not encounter a sperm in the Fallopian tube and is not fertilised, it will be discarded with the lining of the womb at the end of the menstrual cycle and you will have a period.      It is important to know that     a released egg can live for up 2 days;     sperms can live for up to 5 days within a woman's body; so if you have unprotected sex up to 5 days before ovulation or a few days after it you may become pregnant.      How do your natural hormones work?      Your ovaries make two hormones which control your menstrual cycle; these are called     oestrogen     progesterone     During the first part of your menstrual cycle (before ovulation) your body is preparing itself for pregnancy; more oestrogen is produced because it makes the lining of the womb thicker so that a fertilised egg can grow in it.   During the second part of the cycle (after ovulation) more progesterone is produced. This stops the growth of the lining of the womb.   If the egg is not fertilised, the amounts of the two hormones decrease and this makes the lining of the womb break down. The lining will be discarded together with the unfertilised egg as a menstrual bleed .   If the egg is fertilised, the two hormones will continue to be produced throughout pregnancy.   The presence of high levels of these two hormones stops    your ovaries releasing any other eggs,   to prevent any further conceptions during pregnancy.   Pills such as Cilest protect you against pregnancy because they contain two synthetic hormones similar to those produced by your body. While taking Cilest your ovaries will not release eggs, so there will be no eggs to be fertilised by the male sperm. These pills also thicken vaginal fluid so that sperm cannot get to the womb and they change the lining of the womb so that eggs cannot grow there.    How effective is the pill?   The pill is an extremely effective method of contraception   if taken properly  . So you must take the pill exactly as described in this leaflet (see section ""How you should take Cilest"").   It is important to remember that no form of contraception, not even the pill can offer 100% protection against pregnancy.     What is in Cilest   Each Cilest pill contains two types of female hormones:     A progestogen called norgestimate (250 micrograms)     An oestrogen called ethinyloestradiol (35 micrograms)     Cilest also contains some inactive ingredients. These are as follows; anhydrous lactose (a type of sugar), magnesium stearate, pregelatinised starch and FD & C blue No 2. (No E132).     What should Cilest look like?   Cilest comes in a carton containing 1 or 3 blister strips, each containing 21 light blue coloured pills.     What type of medicine is Cilest?   Cilest is a combined low dose oral contraceptive.     Who is licensed to sell Cilest?   Janssen-Cilag Ltd., Saunderton, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire HP14 4HJ.     Who makes Cilest?   Cilag AG, Hochstrasse 201/209, CH-8201 Schaffhausen, Switzerland.     How do Cilest pills work?     They stop a woman's ovaries releasing eggs.     They thicken vaginal fluid so that sperm cannot get to the womb.     They change the lining of the womb so that eggs are unable to grow there.       What is Cilest used for?   Cilest is used to prevent pregnancy. It may also be recommended by your doctor for other reasons.     Is Cilest suitable for you?   Do you use these pills if:     You are or think you may be pregnant     You have, or have ever had, problems with your circulation e.g. phlebitis or blood clotting severe liver disease hepatitis or jaundice systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)     You have had any of the following problems while you were pregnant or taking steroids jaundice severe skin itching herpes of pregnancy a problem of hearing called otosclerosis     You have any of the following conditions Rotor syndrome Dubin-Johnson syndrome Porphyria Liver cell tumours moderate or severe high blood pressure the high blood cholesterol or lipid (fat) disorder known as hyperlipoproteinaemia gallstones     You have, or have ever had, tumours of breast womb ovary       You have other gynaecological problems e.g. thickening   of the lining of the womb unusual or irregular vaginal bleeding which your doctor does not know about.     If you are not sure about any of these conditions you should talk to your doctor - he/she will consider your medical history and decide whether Cilest is suitable for you to take.   There are certain conditions which you may have or have had in the past, where you can still use Cilest but your doctor may need to monitor you more regularly. If you already have one of these or you develop any whilst you are taking Cilest, please tell your doctor - he/she can then decide whether you should continue to take the pill. These include the following:   Severe varicose veins A prolonged period of bed rest Blood clotting problems Smoking High blood pressure High blood cholesterol or lipids (fats) Heart or kidney problems or diabetes Obesity Epilepsy Migraine Gallstones Fibroids, endometriosis Severe depression Liver problems Sickle cell disease   If you are to have an operation/major surgery.   It is   important   to tell your doctor about any of these. Again, if you are not sure about any you should discuss it with your doctor.     Are you taking other medicines?    It is important that you tell your doctor about any other medicines you are taking including any that you have bought yourself. Some other medicines may prevent Cilest form working properly so that you could get pregnant. These include:       Drugs used for epilepsy/fits Antibiotics and certain anti-fungal drugs e.g. griseofulvin Laxatives and charcoal Barbiturates   Cilest may still be used if you are taking antibiotics to treat acne but you should discuss this with your doctor.   If you take insulin or other drugs for diabetes, you may need to change their dose.    Special Warnings:   Cilest should not be used while breast feeding as it may reduce the amount of breast milk.   You should have talked to your doctor about any present and past medical problems as listed above and have had a full examination, including a cervical smear and any necessary other tests, before starting to take the pill. These should be repeated regularly.   Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious side-effects to oral contraceptive use, such as heart and blood vessel problems, blood clots/thrombosis.   You are strongly advised to give up smoking especially if you are aged over 35 years.   If your periods are not regular before you start taking the pill you should tell your doctor.   Cilest should not be used for 4 6 weeks before an operation/surgery and not used again until 2 weeks after you are fully mobile. This also applies to any situation where you may need to rest or be immobile for some time.   Some women may develop patches of darkened skin whilst taking Cilest. This is more likely to happen if you developed patches of darkened skin during a previous pregnancy. If you develop such patches, you should avoid the sun and ultraviolet light (sunbeds). These patches of darkened skin may not disappear even when you have stopped taking the pill.   Cilest may affect the results of certain blood andurine tests - please tell the doctor/nurse that you are taking Cilest when you have any such tests.     How you should take Cilest   The pill is a very effective contraceptive when used properly. It is important to take Cilest exactly as your doctor told you and as stated below:    When to start   It is best that you start taking Cilest on the first day of your period - if you do this no extra contraceptive cover is required.   If your period has already begun, start taking Cilest on day 5 (counting the first day of period as day 1) whether or not your bleeding has stopped. In this case, extra contraception (e.g. condoms) must be used for the first 7 days of pill taking.   If your period started more than 5 days ago do not start taking Cilest until the first day of your next period. Use extra contraception until then.     How to take Cilest   Cilest comes in a pack marked with the days of the week. Take your first pill marked with the right day.   Each day take the pill for that day and do this for the 27 pills in the pack. It is best to take your pill at around the same time each day - most people find it easier to remember taking it before bedtime.   When you have taken all 21 pills and the pack is empty leave a break of exactly 7 days after the last pill and the start of your next pack.   During this ""pill-free"" week you should have some days of bleeding similar to a ""period"".   Start your next pack of Cilest after exactly seven ""pill-free"" days. Each new pack of Cilest will begin on the same day of the week as the previous pack; so it is easy to remember when to start again.   Continue with this pack and future packs in the same way as described above.   If you take Cilest as above, extra contraception is not required.   NB: In some cases your doctor may tell you to start taking your next pack without leaving a 7 day gap. (See ""Extra contraception: The 7 day rule"").   If you do not have any bleeding during the ""pill-free"" week of any pack and if you have no other reason why Cilest should not have worked properly (i.e. you did not have to use extra contraception - see later) then you are highly unlikely to be pregnant. Start your next pack of Cilest even though you have not had a period. If you still do not have a period during the ""pill-free"" week of this pack, go to your doctor. He/she will check that you are not pregnant before you continue to take Cilest.   If you do not have any bleeding during the ""pill-free"" week of any pack and you have a reason why Cilest may not have worked properly i.e. you   DID   need to use extra contraception (see later) go to your doctor. He/she will check that you are not pregnant before you re-start Cilest.     After being pregnant/having a baby   You can start using Cilest after 21 days if you are not breast-feeding and you had a vaginal delivery with no complications and you are fully mobile.   If you do have intercourse before you start taking Cilest or before you first period wait until your period starts before you take Cilest and then take it on the first day of bleeding. This is because you can get pregnant very soon after having a baby and you have to make sure that you are not pregnant before taking Cilest.   If you start taking Cilest more than 21 days after delivery and you haven't had intercourse or a period you should use extra contraception for the first 7 days.   If you are breastfeeding you should not use Cilest or any other combined oral contraceptive as this may affect your breast milk. You may be able to use a progestogen only pill - discuss this with your doctor.     After miscarriage or abortion   You can start taking Cilest on the first day after a miscarriage or abortion. You will not need extra contraception if you start taking the pill straight away.     Ask your doctor about other contraception if you are not starting Cilest immediately.     Changing from another type of pill   What sort of pill were you on?    Another 21 day pill   Finish the pack of contraceptive pills you are on. Start taking Cilest on the very next day. Do not leave a break between packs or wait for your period to begin.   You may get a light period whilst you are taking tablets or no period at all until after you have finished your first pack of Cilest.     Every day pill (""ED"" pack)   Finish the first 21 pills of your ED or 28 day pack. Take your first Cilest pill the next day. Do not leave a break between packs or wait for your next period to begin. You may not have a period until after you have finished your first pack of Cilest or you may get a light period whilst taking Cilest.   Safely dispose of the remaining 7 pills from your old 28 day pack.     Mini pill (progestogen-only pill)   Start taking Cilest on the first day of your period, even if you have already taken a mini pill on that day.   Safely dispose of the rest of the pills in your old pack of mini pills. No extra contraceptive cover is required.   If you do not have a period, start taking Cilest on the day after the last mini pill in your pack.   You   must use   extra contraception for the first 7 days of taking Cilest.      To skip a period   Start a new pack of Cilest on the next day after finishing the pack you are taking i.e. do not leave a 7 day gap between packs. Pill taking should then continue as usual.   You may have some spotting or slight bleeding whilst taking the pills of the second pack. Do not worry - this will not affect your contraceptive cover. Start the next pack after the usual 7 day break even if you are still spotting/bleeding.      What might stop your pill working?    Forgetting to take a pill   If you forget to take a pill, check when your missed pill was due and then follow the instructions on the chart as outlined in the Missed Pill Guide.     Having a stomach upset - vomiting/diarrhoea   If your symptoms stop within 12 hours of taking a pill, just take an extra pill from a spare pack of Cilest and carry on taking pills as usual from the next day.   If the upset carries on over 12 hours use extra contraception for as long as you are ill and for the next 7 days after that.   Carry on with the rest of your pack as usual.   If you are sick or have diarrhoea in the last 7 days of the pack start your next pack without a break. If you do not have a period following the end of this new pack, discuss this with your doctor before starting another pack.      Missed Pill Guide:      What to do if you miss or forget to take your pill      When was your missed pill due  ?     Less than 12 hours ago.     Don't worry     Take the forgotten pill now     Take the rest of your pills at the usual times     That's all     More than 12 hours ago.     Take the latest pill now     Throw away any others you missed     Take the rest of your pills at the usual times     Use extra contraception for the next 7 days     Go to 2.        How many pills are left in your pack?      7 or more pills.     Use extra contraception for the next 7 days. When you finish your pack leave a break of 7 days before you take the first pill in your next pack.        Less than 7 pills     Use extra contraception for the next 7 days     Do not leave a break between packs i.e. start a new pack of Cilest the day after finishing the current pack. If you do not have a period following the end of this new pack   discuss this with your doctor before starting another pack  .     Use other contraception, such as a condom in the meantime.    Extra contraception: The 7 day rule   It is important that extra contraception is used in the following situations:     If a pill is missed or forgotten for more than 12 hours     If sickness or diarrhoea lasts for more than 12 hours     If you are taking any of the medicines e.g. antibiotics listed under the section ""Are you taking other medicines?""     You should still take your Cilest pill each day but use other contraception as well for 7 days after any of these events.    If there are less than 7 pills left in your Cilest pack when any of the above events happens, you must start the next pack as soon as you have finished the one before without leaving a 7 day gap. If you do not have a period following the end of this new pack, discuss with your doctor before starting another pack .     Extra contraception:   You can use     a condom     a cap or diaphragm with a spermicide     a contraceptive sponge     If you use any of these, follow the instructions carefully.     What to do if you take too many Cilest pills?   If a large number of Cilest pills are taken, contact your doctor for advice. There have been no reports of serious problems from an overdose of Cilest.     How safe is the pill?   The pill is one of the most thoroughly tested products of medical research and vast experience has confirmed that it can be safely used by most women BUT   it is important to know that even if a product has been used by a great number of patients for a large number of years, it is not possible to guarantee that the product is completely safe for all patients, because each person is unique. So, with the pill (as with any other medicine}, some risk to health must be accepted.    What side effects may Cilest have?   As with any other oral contraceptive pill, Cilest may cause some unwanted effects but this is not common. The most serious side effects are:      Blood clots and thrombosis which can occur in different blood vessels causing problems such as a pulmonary embolus {blood clot in the lung}, a stroke or a heart attack. These are rare but serious and may be fatal.      Certain conditions themselves increase the risk of thrombosis: heavy smoking, obesity, severe varicose veins, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, migraine, diabetes. If any of these conditions applies to you, you have a greater risk of having a thrombosis. This risk is increased if you take Cilest.   The signs and symptoms of a blood clot are described under ""Reasons for stopping Cilest immediately""; if you develop any of those signs or symptoms, stop taking Cilest at once and see your doctor.   Women who do not take the oral contraceptive pill can also have blood clots and thrombosis, but statistics show that women who take the pill have a higher risk of these disorders than those who don't. It is thought that the risk of thrombosis is lower for modern pills such as Cilest, because they contain lower levels of oestrogen than the older types of pill.     There have been many studies of women taking combined oral contraceptives (COC's) looking at the effect of these pills on the risk of developing cancer of the ovary, uterus, cervix and breast. These have   shown clearly that COCs offer good protection against cancer of the ovary and uterus.     Some studies showed an increased risk of cancer of the cervix in women using COCs for a long time but it is not clear whether this is due to other factors such as sexual behaviour or to the COCs alone.   The link between COC use and breast cancer is not yet clear. Some studies suggest an increased risk of breast cancer appearing in under 35 year olds and that this risk increases with the length of use of the pill. If there is a possible increased risk of breast cancer with COCs it is likely to be small and expected to be less with pills containing low oestrogen doses, such as Cilest. This possible risk should be balanced against the many other benefits of COCs which includes the protection which they provide against cancer of the uterus and ovary.   You should always have regular cervical smears and breast examinations whilst you are taking Cilest.     Benign and malignant liver tumours     Gallstones     Jaundice     Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)     Involuntary limb movements     If any of the above (1-7) occur or are suspected, you should stop taking Cilest immediately and consult your doctor.   Other effects may include:   raised blood pressure bleeding between periods; changes in vaginal discharge; fibroids; very severe period pains; thrush; worsening of endometriosis, no periods on stopping the pill your breasts may feel tender, painful or they may get slightly larger or ooze a little milk feeling or being sick skin rashes, patches of darkened skin, small red marks on skin, red lumpy swellings on the legs problems with contact lenses headaches, migraines, moodiness or depression fluid retention – you may notice swollen ankles or stomach or changes in weight raised blood sugar changes in libido (interest in sex)   If you notice any of these effects or any other unusual symptoms please tell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible. Never miss your check ups with your doctor. Your doctor can check for side effects which you may not notice yourself.     Reasons for stopping Cilest immediately   You must stop taking Cilest   immediately   and   consult your doctor   if:     you experience any of the following   signs/symptoms of a blood clot:      severe pain or tenderness or swelling in the calf of one or both legs.   unexpected chest pain, shortness of breath or coughing up blood unexpected numbness, tingling, severe headache,  dizziness, fainting, fitting, problems with eyesight or speech. unexpected stomach pains.     you become jaundiced     you are to have an operation/major surgery     you have to take bed rest or remain immobile for a long time     you develop high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol or lipids     you develop heart or kidney problems or existing problems become worse     you develop epileptic fits or your existing epilepsy worsens     you develop migraine or your existing migraine worsens     you develop severe depression or your existing depression worsens     you develop fibroids or endometriosis or your existing fibroids/endometriosis worsen     you develop gallstones     you develop blood clotting problems or your existing problems worsen     if you know or suspect that you may be pregnant, as the pill might affect the normal development of the child in the early stages of pregnancy and there is a very small risk of foetal malformation.       Does the pill offer any extra benefits?   Your periods will become very regular and bleeding will probably become lighter.   Period pains will usually lessen.   Premenstrual tension (PMT) usually becomes less severe or may disappear.   Long term use of the pill reduces the risk of cancers of the ovaries and of the lining of the womb by approximately a half.   The pill may prevent painful lumpy breasts.   The pill offers some protection against some infections of the internal genital organs.     What if you decide to have a baby?   The periods you get during the ""pill free"" week are not true periods. It is important that you have a true period before getting pregnant so that your doctor is able to know when your baby is due to be born. So once you have stopped taking Cilest because you wish to try to become pregnant, use another method of contraception until you have had a true period.     How should you store Cilest?   Store at room temperature (below 256C). Protect tablets from light. Other important points: Keep out of reach of children.     Do not use these pills     After the expiry date shown on the label.     If the Cilest pack is damaged.     If the pills are discoloured.      Date of preparation:   July 1995 Revised in: November 1995       ",

"    WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT NEORAL (CYCLOSPORIN) SOFT GELATIN CAPSULES   Please read this leaflet carefully before you start to take this medicine, even if you have taken   NEORAL   Soft Gelatin Capsules before. You will notice that the advice contained in this leaflet may vary depending on whether you are receiving the drug for transplantation or taking it for your skin condition or as treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. If you have any questions or are unsure about anything, ask your doctor or pharmacist (chemist) for advice.    WHAT'S IN YOUR MEDICINE   NEORAL Soft Gelatin Capsules contain cyclosporin.    The capsules are available in 3 strengths They contain either     25mg cyclosporin (blue-grey and marked with the Sandoz logo and ‘25mg’)     50mg cyclosporin (yellow-white and marked with the Sandoz logo and ‘50mg’)     100mg cyclosporin (blue-grey and marked with the Sandoz logo and ‘lOOmg’) 100mg cyclosporin (blue-grey and marked with the Sandoz logo and ‘lOOmg’) All three capsule strengths contain the following inactive ingredients: DL-a     Packs contain 5 or 30 capsules.   The name of your medicine is   NEORAL   and it contains cyclosporin. It is one of a group of drugs known as immunosuppressive agents. These drugs are used to dampen down the body’s immune reactions.    NEORAL   Soft Gelatin Capsules are manufactured by: Product Licence Holders:   R P Scherer GmbHSANDOZ PHARMACEUTICALS Gammelsbacher Strasse 2Frimley Business Park D-69412 EberbachFrimley, Camberley GermanySurrey, GU16 5SG    WHY DOES YOUR DOCTOR WANT YOU TO USE NEORAL SOFT GELATIN CAPSULES?       If you have received an organ or bone marrow transplant   Although you may have undergone a series of tests before your organ or bone marrow transplant to ensure that the match between your body and the transplanted organ or bone marrow was as close as possible, the donor tissue will still not be identical to your tissue. As a result, your body’s immune system will try to reject the donor tissue.   NEORAL   helps to stop this rejection response by blocking the development of special cells which would normally attack the transplanted tissue.     If you have a severe skin complaint   Some skin conditions, such as severe psoriasis or eczema (atopic dermatitis) are thought to be caused by your immune system overreacting.   NEORAL   may help to stop this by suppressing the immune system, thereby improving your skin condition.       If you have severe rheumatoid arthritis   It is thought that rheumatoid arthritis may be caused by inappropriate immune responses in your body.   NEORAL   may help to stop this by suppressing your immune system, thereby improving your rheumatoid arthritis.     If you were previously  taking SANDIMMUN (cyclosporin) Soft Gelatin Capsules or Oral Solution    NEORAL and   SANDIMMUN   both contain cyclosporin as the active ingredient. However,   NEORAL   is an improved formulation of cyclosporin and is, therefore, different to   SANDIMMUN  .   Because of this difference the absorption of cyclosporin into your blood should be much more reliable with   NEORAL  . Absorption of cyclosporin with   NEORAL   Soft Gelatin Capsules is much less likely to be affected by taking it with food, again resulting in more consistent levels at cyclosporin in your blood. This is thought to be of particular importance in the prevention of rejection following transplantation, especially in the longer term.   Because of the difference in absorption of cyclosporin, your doctor will probably want to monitor you more closely for a short period following transfers from   SANDIMMUN   to   NEORAL  , to make sure that you get the ideal dose for you. If your doctor transfers you from   SANDIMMUN   to   NEORAL  , you should not go back to taking   SANDIMMUN   unless your doctor tells you to.   If you were previously using   SANDIMMUN   and your doctor has now transferred you to   NEORAL  , any unused   SANDIMMUN   that you have got left over should be returned to your pharmacist.     BEFORE USING YOUR MEDICINE   Tell your doctor before you start taking   NEORAL   Soft Gelatin Capsules it the answer to any the following questions is yes:     Do you suspect that you have had an allergic reaction to or been upset by any of the ingredients in   NEORAL   (listed in ‘What’s in your Medicine ‘)?     Do you have any kidney problems or have you had any disease which may have affected your kidneys?     Do you have high blood pressure?     Do you have an infection of any type?     Have you been told that you have any kind ot tumour?     Do you have any liver problems or have you had any disease which may have affected your liver?     Have you been told that you have high levels ot potassium in your blood or that you have gout?     Do you have any skin conditions other than severe psoriasis or severe eczema?     Are you taking any other medicines (either bought or prescribed)?     Are you taking any other medicines (either bought or prescribed)?   Some medicines can interfere with your treatment so make sure to check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking any other medicines. In particular tell your doctor it you are taking any of the following:     antibiotics or antifungal medicines for treatment of infection     oral contraceptive tablets      any medicines for heart problems or high blood pressure     anti-epileptic medicines     cholesterol lowering medicines     other immunosuppressive medicines (eg prednisolone)     sleeping tablets     potassium supplements     medicines to encourage urination       anti-inflammatory medicines (i.e. NSAIDs) eg. diclofenac     light treatment (PUVA or other UV treatment) for your skin condition     colchicine     Are you pregnant, or planning to become pregnant? If you do become pregnant whiIst taking   NEORAL  , tell your doctor     Are you breast feeding?     Have you recently received any vaccinations or are you planning to have any vaccinations?     Are you likely to be exposed to the sun a great deal without protecting your skin with a sun block cream?     Do you regularly use a sun bed?     Has the medicinc been prescribed for the treatment of eczema in sorneone who is less than 16 years of age?     Has the medicine been prescribed for the treatment of severe rheumatoid arthritis in someone who is Iess than 18 years of age?     Has the medicine been prescribed for the treatment of severe rheumatoid arthritis in someone who is Iess than 18 years of age?     TAKING YOUR MEDICINE   Your doctor will work out the correct dose of   NEORAL   for you depending on your body weight and whether you are taking   NEORAL   following a transplant or as a treatment for severe psoriasis, eczema or rheumatoid arthritis. Your doctor will also tell you how often to take your medicine.   If you have had an organ or bone marrow transplant the total dose is usually within the range of 2mg/kg body weight per day and 15mg/kg body weight per day. Generally, the higher doses are used just after transplantation and the lower doses are used once your transplanted organ or bone marrow has stabilised. Your doctor will adjust your dose to one that is ideal for you. To do this he may need to do some blood tests.   For the treatment of severe psoriasis and eczema the total dose is usually within the range of 2.5mg/kg body weight per day and 5mg/kg body weight per day.   For the treatment of severe rheumatoid arthritis, the total daily dose is usually within the range of 2.5mg/kg body weight per day and 4mg/kg body weight per day.   Your doctor will tell you how much   NEORAL   to take and how long you will need to take   NEORAL  , depending on whether you are taking it following transplantation or for the treatment of a severe skin condition or rheumatoid arthritis. For the treatment of severe eczema, treatment usually lasts for 8 weeks.   Follow your doctor’s instructions exactly and never change the dose yourself, however well you feel.

"      Puregon    What you should know about Puregon   Please read the following information carefully before using this medicine. The leaflet contains details about Puregon, as well as some general advice on using medicines. If you have any questions or other concerns, please ask your doctor or pharmacist.     Name of your medicine   The medicine prescribed for you is called Puregon.     Composition and strength - what your medicine contains   Puregon contains a hormone known as follicle-stimulating hormone (or FSH) in a strength of 100 I.U. per ampoule.   Besides FSH, the powder contains sucrose, sodium citrate, and polysorbate 20- the solvent contains sodium chloride (4.5 mg) and water for injections (1.0 ml).     Pharmaceutical form - what your medicine consists of   Puregon 100 I.U. is supplied in a glass ampoule as a dry powder, which should be dissolved with the solvent contained in a second glass ampoule. It is available in packs of 1, 3, 5 and 10 ampoules.     Therapeutic group - how your medicine works   Gonadotropins (including FSH) play an important role in human fertility and reproduction. FSH is needed in women for the growth and development of follicles in the ovaries. Follicles are small round sacs that contain the egg cells.     Marketing authorisation holder and manufacturer:   Organon (Ireland) Limited P.O. Box 2857, Drynam Road, Swords, Co. Dublin, Ireland.     Indications - when your medicine is used   Puregon is used to treat infertility in either of the following situations:     In women who are not ovulating Puregon can be used to cause ovulation in women who have not responded to treatment with clomiphene citrate.     In women undergoing assisted reproduction techniques (ART), including in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) and other methods, Puregon can be used to bring about the development of multiple follicles.       Contraindications - when you should not use this medicine   There are certain medical conditions in which Puregon should no be used. Do   not   use Puregon if you:     have a tumour of the ovary, breast, uterus, pituitary gland or hypothalamus.     are pregnant or breast-feeding.     are allergic to any of the substances of Puregon.     have heavy or irregular vaginal bleeding where the cause is not known.     have ovarian cysts or enlarged ovaries not caused by polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD).     This medicine should not be used when a condition exists which makes a normal pregnancy impossible. This may occur with primary ovarian failure, when there are fibroids in the uterus or when certain malformations of the sexual organs are present.     Special warnings and precautions for use Caution   Close supervision of patients by a doctor is very important. Usually ultrasound scans of the ovaries are regularly made, and blood or urine samples are regularly taken. The results of these tests allow the doctor to choose the correct dose of Puregon from day to day. This is very important since too high a dose of FSH may lead to rare but serious complications in which the ovaries become overstimulated. This may be noticed as pain in the abdomen. Regular monitoring of the response to FSH-treatment helps the doctor to prevent ovarian overstimulation. So contact your doctor without delay if you are experiencing significant abdominal pain, also if this occurs some days after the last injection has been given.     Interactions - when you are taking other medicines   If Puregon is used in combination with clomiphene citrate there may be an increased follicular response. If a GnRH agonist has been given, higher dose of Puregon may be needed to achieve a response.        Women who are not ovulating:   Treatment usually starts with the administration of 75 I.U. FSH per day. The starting dose is continued for at least seven days. If there is no ovarian response, the daily dose will then be gradually increased until follicle growth and/ or plasma oestradiol levels indicate an adequate response. The daily dose is then maintained until a follicle of adequate size is present. Usually 7 to 14 days of treatment are sufficient. The administration of Puregon is then stopped and ovulation can be induced by administering human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).       Step 5 - Checking the correct needle position   If the needle position is correct the plunger should be quite difficult to draw back. Any blood sucked back into the syringe means that the needle tip has penetrated a vein or artery. If this happens pull out the syringe, cover the injection site with a swab containing disinfectant and apply pressure; the site will stop bleeding in a minute or two. Do not use this solution but flush it away. You should then start again with   Step 1   using a new needle and new ampoules of Puregon and sodium chloride solution.     Step - Injecting the solution   Depress the plunger slowly and steadily, so the solution is correctly injected and the muscle or skin tissues are not damaged.     Step 7 - Removing the syringe   Pull the syringe out quickly and apply pressure to the injection site with a swab containing disinfectant. A gentle massage of the site - while still maintaining pressure - helps disperse the Puregon solution and relieve any discomfort.   Any remaining solution should be discarded.   Do not mix the Puregon solution with any other medicines.     Overdose   Too high a dose may cause overstimulation of the ovaries. See Section on Undesirable Effects below.    Undesirable effects - unwanted effects   A serious complication with FSH is unwanted overstimulation of the ovaries. This condition is rare, and the risk can be reduced by careful monitoring of follicle development during treatment. The first symptoms of ovarian overstimulation may be noticed as pain in the abdomen, feeling sick or diarrhoea. In more severe  cases symptoms may include enlargement of the ovaries, accumulation of fluid in the abdomen and/or chest, weight gain and the occurrence of blood clots in the circulation. Contact your doctor without delay if you are experiencing any of these symptoms, also if they develop some days after the last injection has been given.   Minor side effects include bruising, pain, redness, swelling and itching at the site of the injection.     Shelf life and storage precautions - looking after your medicine   Keep Puregon in the original box in a safe place out of the reach of children.   Puregon should be stored below 30°C and protected from light. Do not freeze. The expiry date is printed on the box and on the label after 'exp.'. Do not use Puregon after this date.   Any unused solution should be discarded.   This information was last updated in December 1995.     General things to remember about medicines     This medicine has been prescribed only for your current medical problem. It should not be used for other medical conditions.     Never give your medicine to anyone else and do not use medicines meant for other people.     Tell your doctor treating you, which medicines you are currently taking.

Internal piles (swollen blood vessels inside the anus) can produce varying degrees of discomfort, itch, and irritation, particularly during and just after a bowel movement.   The soothing action of Anusol Suppositories combats the symptoms of internal piles while their antiseptic properties help to reduce inflammation and assist healing.   Piles are caused by a number of different factors. These are discussed on the reverse of this leaflet together with helpful advice for sufferers.     Possible side effects   Side effects do not occur very often, but if anything unusual happens, consult your doctor.   Very occasionally, a mild irritation or a burning sensation may be experienced. These sensations will usually cease when you stop using the suppositories.    Date of last revision: January 1994          A Healthy Living Plan for Piles Sufferers   At least 40 per cent of people suffer at some time in their lives from piles. Despite the frequency of the condition, many people are too embarrassed to seek advice or treatment and, as a result, suffer continuous discomfort and misery.   Fortunately, once you have been diagnosed as having piles, there is much you can do to ease the situation and relieve the symptoms. Readily available from your local pharmacy, Anusol Suppositories can help to relieve the pain and discomfort of piles.     What are piles?   Piles (haemorrhoids) are enlarged or swollen blood vessels which can occur inside or outside the anus.    Symptoms of piles   Piles can be present without producing any symptoms at all. but sufferers usually notice the following symptoms    Bleeding:   Blood may appear bright red and scanty on toilet tissue. If the blood is dark in colour, or more profuse, you should consult your doctor.    Swelling:   The swollen blood vessels may be felt as a lump or blockage in the anus after passing a motion.    Itching, irritation and pain   in the anal region.      What causes piles?   A number of factors can contribute to the development of piles:     Excessive straining during bowel movement, usually the result of constipation.     Pregnancy, the pressure of a growing baby within the lower abdomen results in increased pressure in the anal vessels. This may lead to swelling and distension.     Heredity     Competing in games where bursts of high energy movement are required.     Lifting or heavy manual work resulting in straining or pressure on the lower abdomen.     If you think you might have piles, you should consult your doctor, particularly if:     the sufferer is pregnant     the sufferer is a child     symptoms are severe and/or persistent     blood from the anal area is dark in colour     any bleeding is profuse or persistent     there is a change in normal bowel habit lasting for more than two weeks     there is persistent pain in the abdomen.      For external and internal piles, cream is available. If extra protection for dry, irritated skin is needed, ointment can be used. If internal haemorrhoids are the problem, suppositories deliver a measured dose to the affected area.     ",

"    Patient Information Leaflet    Efcortelan Cream    Trade mark      What you should know about Efcortelan Cream    What your cream does   Efcortelan Cream is a mild treatment for inflamed skin conditions such as eczema and dermatitis.      IT IS IMPORTANT TO READ THIS CAREFULLY BEFORE STARTING TREATMENT   Following this advice gives the cream a chance to work safely and effectively.    What is in your cream   Efcortelan Cream is one of a group of medicines called topical steroids. ""Topical"" means they are put on the skin. Topical steroids reduce the redness and itchiness of certain skin problems. (They should not be confused with ""anabolic"" steroids misused by some body builders and taken as tablets or injections).   Efcortelan Cream is a mild topical steroid and is often used to manage skin problems in between short courses of a stronger preparation.   Ingredients of the cream include:   The active ingredient - hydrocortisone 0.5%, 1%, or 2.5% (see label) a preservative - chlorocresol in a base containing cetomacrogol 1000, cetostearyl alcohol, white soft paraffin and liquid paraffin.   The cream does not contain any lanolin, parabens or colouring agents.     Before you use your cream   This cream has been prescribed to treat the skin problem that you showed to your doctor.   DO NOT put it on any other skin problems as it could make them worse, especially skin infections such as cold sores, herpes, impetigo, athletes foot, chicken pox, ringworm or thrush.   If you have had an allergy to any creams or ointments in the past If you think you may be pregnant   Did you tell your doctor at the last visit or an earlier visit?   IF YOU DID   NOT   TELL YOUR DOCTOR THEN YOU SHOULD DO SO   BEFORE   STARTING THE TREATMENT   Even so, your doctor may still want you to use the cream.    Face –   YOU SHOULD NOT normally use on the face for many weeks or months.     Children –   DO NOT use under the napkin, or airtight dressing of an infant for more than one week. (These make it easier for the active ingredient to pass through the skin).      How to use your cream   If your doctor has told you in detail HOW MUCH to use and HOW OFTEN then keep to this advice.   If you are not sure then follow the advice on the back of this leaflet.      Unless told by your doctor:     YOU SHOULD NOT use more than this.     YOU SHOULD NOT use on large areas of the body for a long time (such as nearly every day for many weeks or months). Although Efcortelan Cream is generally regarded as safe even when used like this for many months it may be possible to produce side effects if   overused  . Such overuse may thin the skin so that it damages easily and some of the active ingredient may pass through the skin and affect other parts of the body, especially in infants and children.      Has the cream any side effects?      Most people find using this cream causes no problems when used in the right amount for the correct length of time (See above as well as guidance on back of this leaflet).   IF you find your condition gets worse during treatment you may be allergic to the cream or have a skin infection.    STOP USING THE CREAM AND TELL YOUR DOCTOR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE   Repeated courses of topical steroids over a long period of time may sometimes cause changes in hair growth and skin colour.      Guidance on how much cream to use   If your doctor has told you in detail how to use the cream then keep to that advice otherwise:- two or three times a day, after washing your hands, gently rub the correct amount of cream into the skin until it has all disappeared.      For an adult:   You should find that two fingertips of cream will treat both hands or one foot three fingertips of cream will treat one arm six fingertips of cream will treat one leg fourteen fingertips of cream will treat the front and back of one trunk    Fingertip Units               Do not worry if you find you need a little more or a little less than this - it is only a rough guide.   Wash your hands before using the cream. Gently rub the correct amount into the skin until it has all disappeared.   Unless   used for treating the hands wash them again   after   using the cream. Anyone who helps to rub in the cream should also do the same or wear disposable plastic gloves.      For a child:   The smaller the child the less you use.   A child of 6 months to 1 year needs about a quarter of the adult amount and a child of  4 years about one third.

"      Multiload Cu250,   Short Cu250 and Cu375   Birth control is an issue which at one time or another you share with many women all over the world. Fortunately, there are now a number of reliable and simple methods of preventing pregnancy. One of these is called intrauterine contraception. This method, although not guaranteeing absolute protection against pregnancy, is indeed very reliable. The intrauterine device (IUD) which your doctor has advised you to use is called Multiload.   Before starting to tell you how Multiload works, we would first like to explain a few things.    A short anatomy lesson   The womb or uterus (c) is situated in the lower part of the abdomen, just above the pubic bone. The uterus is more or less pear-shaped, has muscular walls and is slightly smaller than your fist. Access to the uterus is by means of the vagina (e). At the top and on both sides of the uterus are the fallopian tubes (a) with ovaries (b) beneath them. The ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus and vagina together form the female organs of reproduction. They do not function until puberty.     Figure 1     fallopian tubes     ovaries     uterus     cervix     vagina     From the time when a woman starts menstruating she is sexually mature. Approximately every four weeks a tiny egg cell (which is smaller than this dot.) ripens in one of the ovaries. This egg cell (a) travels to the fallopian tube where it may be fertilised with male seed cells (sperms = b) or not.   Meanwhile, the uterus prepares to receive a fertilised egg. The inside of the uterus is lined with a specialised mucous membrane (c) through which run many tiny blood vessels. About the time when an egg is ripe for fertilisation, this membrane - the endometrium - becomes twice as thick as normal and the blood vessels supply it with an extra quantity of blood.   If the egg in the fallopian tube is not fertilised, a part of the endometrium is shed after fourteen days together with a quantity of blood. In other words, menstruation (d) takes place.   If the egg is fertilised, it travels from the fallopian tube to the uterus. Here, it (e) implants in the    Figure 2  endometrium, generally high up in the uterus. This whole process takes about one week.   When implantation occurs, the endometrium is not shed and no menstruation takes place.    The background to IUDs, an age-old method rediscovered   For more than 2000 years it has been known that pregnancy could be prevented by inserting objects such as a stone, a ring or a wire into the uterus. Since the start of this century doctors have carried out extensive research in order to develop a reliable way of contraception based on this age-old knowledge. Why lUDs prevent pregnancy is not exactly known, but studies point towards two possible actions. They may prevent fertilisation by their action on the fallopian tube; alternatively should an egg be fertilised they may prevent implantation in the uterus.   Early devices were made of metals such as gold, silver and stainless steel. In the 1940s and 50s, pliable plastics were used to create devices such as the 'loop' and 'coil'. About 1965, it was discovered that by covering an IUD with a layer of copper its contraceptive reliability was increased.   Copper-carrying lUDs are effective at a smaller overall size than lUDs without copper. This gives copper lUDs the advantage of being easier to insert.     Multiload   There are various types of lUDs in existence. One of these is Multiload.   It consists of a small plastic rod wound with copper wire and provided with two flexible plastic arms and a nylon thread (Figure 3).       Figure 3 key     flexible plastic arms     small plastic rod with copper wire wound round it     nylon thread        How is Multiload inserted?   After examining your uterus to determine its position size and condition, a speculum is inserted into you; vagina (as for a cervical smear) and the cervix and vagina are cleaned with antiseptic lotion.   The uterus is held steady while its depth is sounded.   Your doctor uses a slender flexible transparent plastic tube to insert Multiload into your uterus. After insertion the two strings attached to Multiload extend into the top of the vagina so that the presence of the device may be checked by you or your doctor (Figures 4 and 5).      Figure 4       Figure 5 (A, B and C): These pictures show how Multiload is inserted.     The flexibility of Multiload makes it easy to pass the portio.     This picture shows that Multiload has been completely inserted into the uterus.     In this manner the insertion tube is removed. Multiload stays in the uterus.        Figure 5A  Figure 5B  Figure 5C          While you are wearing Multiload   From the first day onwards, Multiload protects you against pregnancy with a high degree of security.   Neither you nor your partner will experience the presence of Multiload during intercourse. If otherwise, please consult your doctor.   Menstrual tampons can be freely used. You need only to feel for the strings after each menstruation. Your doctor will instruct you how to do this. If you do not feel the strings, or you do feel the firm part of Multiload, you should contact your doctor.     Possible complications   Multiload is usually well tolerated. Only a few women may experience a slight discomfort during insertion and/or during use. In rare cases a complication might develop later on. You should be aware of the nature and symptoms of such a complication so that you know what should be done in such a case.   Soon after Multiload has been fitted, you may possibly experience abdominal pain or cramps which usually quickly subside. However, in case of serious and persistent abdominal complaints or heavy bleeding you must consult your doctor.   Your first, and sometimes also your second menstruation may come slightly earlier than expected. These periods may also be a little more painful, heavier and last longer than usual. Sometimes there is a little bleeding on and off between periods. This is nothing to worry about but tell your doctor during your next visit. After two or three months everything should be back to normal again.   There have been occasional reports of breakage of the thread or very rarely of the plastic body at removal of the Multiload. This is mostly associated with embedding of the device or part of it in the uterine wall. Embedding or breakage may require surgical intervention (e.g. curettage) to remove the device or retained fragments.     Attention   Occasionally, it may happen that Multiload may be pushed out of the uterus into the vagina. This is called expulsion. Your uterus remains slightly open during your menstrual period so that the chance of losing Multiload is somewhat greater during these days. Therefore make sure after each period, that you do feel the strings and do not feel the firm part of Multiload. Your doctor has instructed you how to do this. Always wash your hands carefully before and after this examination. You should also check your sanitary towel or tampon before disposing of it.   Women using copper-carrying lUDs, such as Multiload, should not have microwave, shortwave or diathermy treatment to the lower abdomen or back.     Pregnancy   Women fitted with an IUD still have a very slight chance of pregnancy. If in this situation the IUD remains in the uterus, pregnancy could lead to serious complications. Therefore the IUD should be removed as soon as pregnancy is established. This removal may lead to a miscarriage, but this is not always the case.   In addition, with any IUD there is a slightly greater than normal chance that a pregnancy, should it occur, will do so outside the uterus. This is because lUDs provide better protection against intrauterine than against so-called ectopic pregnancy, e.g. in the fallopian tubes. An ectopic pregnancy is a serious condition  urgently requiring medical intervention: for symptoms see section ""Medical advice"".     Genito-urinary infection   During the first few months of IUD use there is a slightly increased risk of infection of the uterus and the fallopian tubes which might affect future fertility.   If an infection occurs is should be treated until it is completely healed: for symptoms see section ""Medical advice"".   To ensure complete healing it may sometimes be necessary that the IUD is removed.     Medical supervision   Your doctor will have taken a thorough medical and gynaecological history in order to decide whether or not there are any medical reasons why you can not use an IUD. Therefore you should inform your doctor about your state of health. In any case, you must not use an IUD if you are pregnant. If in doubt about this ask your doctor for advice.   You should be counselled by your doctor on all aspects of Multiload including those concerning your health and future fertility.   Your doctor should arrange regular check-ups for you.   Inform any doctor you consult that you are wearing an IUD.     Medical advice   In view of the complications described in the sections ""Pregnancy"" and ""Genito-urinary infection"" it is very important to contact your doctor without delay if any of the following symptoms should occur:     symptoms indicative of a pregnancy outside the uterus:     your period is two or more weeks overdue, severe one-sided lower abdominal pain with or without vaginal bleeding, shoulder tip pain or the recent onset of dizziness or fainting.     symptoms indicative of a genito-urinary infection:     flu-like complaints with fever in excess of 38°C (100°F), persistent lower abdominal tenderness or pain, pain during or after sexual intercourse, prolonged or heavy menstrual bleeding, foul-smelling vaginal discharge.     In addition you should contact your doctor:     If your period is two weeks late.     If you think that you have lost Multiload, either because you cannot feel the strings, or if you can feel the firm part of Multiload. Until you have been examined, use an additional form of contraception such as a sheath.     If you plan to use analgesics for more than just a few days.     If any change in your state of health occurs which you think may be due to the use of Multiload.       Removal   Ask your doctor when Multiload should be replaced. With Multiload Cu250, Multiload Cu250 Short this is usually done after 3 years; with Multiload Cu375 this is usually done after 5 years. If necessary remind your doctor of the need of replacement. If you wish to become pregnant, ask your doctor to remove Multiload .    Product licence numbers   Multiload Cu250PL 0065/0062 Multiload Cu250 ShortPL 0065/0075 Multiload Cu375PL 0065/0092      ",

"      Progynova 2 mg    The leaflet for Progynova 2 mg is in the form of a small booklet The information that it contains follows.     Please read this carefully before you start your medicine  .   This booklet only provides a summary of the information available on your medicine. If you have any questions or are not sure about anything ask your doctor or pharmacist.   The reason why you can only get this medicine with a doctor's prescription is that its use needs medical supervision.   Please tell your doctor if you have any doubts or worries about taking this medicine, either before you start or while you are taking it.    What the ""change of life"" means   The ""change of life"" is a long process, normally occurring between the ages of 45 and 55 during which your reproductive organs are undergoing a slow decline. Although the change of life is natural, it often causes distressing symptoms, which are connected with the gradual loss of the hormones produced by the ovaries.    The name of your medicine is:   Progynova 2 mg (oestradiol valerate).     What does Progynova 2 mg contain?   Each tablet contains 2 mg of oestradiol valerate and the following inactive ingredients: lactose, maize starch, povidone 25 000, povidone 700 000, magnesium stearate (E572), sucrose, polyethylene glycol 6 000, calcium carbonate (E170), talc, glycerin (E422), montan glycol wax, titanium dioxide (E171), indigo carmine (E132)   Each pack of Progynova 2 mg contains 3 memo packs (strips) of 28 tablets. Packs containing 1 memo strip of 28 tablets are also available to doctors.   Progynova 2 mg is a hormone replacement therapy.    The product licence is held by   Schering Health Care Ltd, The Brow, Burgess Hill, West Sussex, RH15 9NE.   Progynova 2 mg is manufactured by Schering AG, Berlin, Germany.     How Progynova 2 mg helps you through the ""change of life""   Progynova 2 mg is used for ""hormone replacement therapy"" because it contains the principal oestrogen hormone that is lost during the ""change of life"". Therefore, it replaces the oestrogen that your body can no longer make, and this prevents or improves the troublesome symptoms.   Some women are more likely than others to develop osteoporosis in later life depending on their medical history and lifestyle. If it is appropriate you may be prescribed Progynova 2 mg to prevent osteoporosis. Your doctor will be able to advise you further.    Reasons for not taking Progynova 2 mg   Before taking Progynova 2 mg tell your doctor if you have any of these: clots in the blood vessels (thrombotic disorders) or a history of these conditions severe diabetes with changes to the blood vessels abnormal red blood cells (sickle-cell anaemia); high blood fats (disorders of lipid metabolism); existing or treated hormone-dependent tumours of the breast; a history during pregnancy of (1) itching of the whole body (pruritus of pregnancy), (2) the blister-like rash (most commonly on the palms and soles) known as herpes gestationis, (3) deterioration of inherited deafness (otosclerosis) or (4) jaundice not explained by infections, poisons or obstruction of the flow of bile  (idiopathic jaundice of pregnancy);certain other types of idiopathic jaundice (Dubin-Johnson or Rotor syndromes)- severe disturbances of liver function- previous or existing liver tumours; lumpy, painful breasts (mastopathy); the presence of tissue of the lining of the womb in places of the body where it is not normally found (endometriosis).     What you should know before taking Progynova 2 mg  What you should know before taking Progynova 2    If you have   not   had a hysterectomy (i.e. you still have a womb), you will need to take another hormone called a progestogen, with Progynova 2 mg. Your doctor will be able to advise you further.   Your doctor will carry out gynaecological, blood pressure and other examinations as appropriate, e.g. if you are known to have any liver disease, your doctor will arrange for your liver function to be checked periodically.   Your doctor will examine your breasts periodically during treatment, particularly if there is a history of breast cancer in your family.   During or after the use of hormones such as are contained in Progynova 2 mg, benign liver tumours have rarely occurred, and even more rarely malignant liver tumours. In isolated cases, bleeding from such tumours into the abdomen has endangered life. Although such events are extremely improbable with Progynova 2 mg, you should inform your doctor about any unusual feelings in your upper abdomen that do not disappear within a short time.     Reasons for stopping Progynova 2 mg immediately   There is not known to be any increased risk of blood clotting (thrombosis) during the use of Progynova 2 mg. However, it should not be used if thrombosis is present, and as a precaution you are therefore advised to stop taking Progynova 2 mg at once and consult your doctor if you experience any of the following: the very first attack of migraine (typically a throbbing headache and nausea, preceded by visual disturbances) that you have ever experienced- worsening of pre-existing migraine- any unusually frequent or unusually severe headaches; sudden disturbances of vision or hearing; inflamed veins (phlebitis); pains in the chest or abdomen; swelling in the limbs; pain, tingling or numbness in any part of the body; unexplained cough; breathlessness; pain on breathing.   Progynova 2 mg must also be stopped at once if you develop jaundice, or if your doctor finds your blood pressure to be significantly raised or if you notice an increase in epileptic seizures.   If you have any of the symptoms listed above you should stop taking the tablets and contact your doctor at once.   Ask your doctor for advice on whether you should stop taking the tablets if you are confined to bed, or have an accident or illness, or you need an operation.    What to do if . . .      You are taking other medicines at the same time as Progynova 2 mg   Some drugs e.g. antibiotics and antiepileptics may reduce the effectiveness of Progynova 2 mg.   If you have to take any other medicines regularly, you should inform your doctor.   If you are diabetic your doctor may alter the dose of medicine required to treat your diabetes.   If in doubt about any medicines you are taking, ask your doctor.       How to take Progynova 2 mg    About the pack:   The pack is designed to help you remember to take your medicine.

"    Package insert/Patient information leaflet    Glucobay 100   Tablets each containing 100 mg acarbose.   Glucobay 100 tablets also contain starch, cellulose, magnesium stearate and silicon dioxide.   Glucobay 100 is the first product in a class known as glucosidase inhibitors which delay the digestion of carbohydrates in the intestine.    Made by: Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany   Product Licence holder: Bayer plc, Pharmaceutical Division, Bayer House, Strawberry Hill, Newbury, Berkshire RG14 1JA.   Distributed in the Republic of Ireland by: Bayer Ltd, Dun Laoghaire, Co Dublin.      Please read this leaflet carefully before taking Glucobay     Why have I been prescribed Glucobay 50 by my doctor?   Glucobay has been prescribed for you by your doctor to treat your diabetes.  Glucobay will help to control your blood sugar levels.  This is because Glucobay works by slowing down the digestion of carbohydrates (complex sugars) from your diet, and this reduces the abnormally high blood sugar levels that occur after each meal.     When should I NOT take Glucobay   Do not take Glucobay if you have previously had an allergic reaction to any of the ingredients.  If you are unsure about this ask your doctor.   Do not take Glucobay if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.  If you are taking Glucobay and think that you may be pregnant, or are planning a family, consult your doctor.   Do not take Glucobay if you have a liver disorder.   Do not take Glucobay if you suffer from inflammation or ulceration of the bowel, e.g. ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.   If you have a kidney disorder or a hernia, or have had previous abdominal surgery, do not take Glucobay without consulting your doctor first.     What special precautions should I take?    Treating hypoglycaemic episodes (""hypos ""):   As a diabetic you may also be receiving other treatments for your diabetes.  If you are taking insulin or sulphonylurea drugs to control your blood sugar, you will probably be used to avoiding hypoglycaemic episodes by taking sugar when you feel that your blood sugar level is too low.    When taking Glucobay do not treat a hypoglycaemic episode with ordinary sugar (sucrose).  Instead take some GLUCOSE (also known as dextrose) tablets, syrup, or sweets which should be available from your local chemist.       When and how do I take Glucobay   To gain the maximum benefit from Glucobay you should adhere to the diet prescribed for you by your doctor.  This will also help in reducing any side-effects you may experience.   Take the tablets as prescribed by your doctor. This will normally be one or two tablets taken with meals three times a day.  However, when you first start your treatment, your doctor may recommend that you take your tablets once or twice a day before increasing your dose to three times a day.  Glucobay tablets should be chewed with the first mouthful of food.  If you prefer not to chew the tablets then swallow them whole with a little liquid   immediately before the meal.      Do not exceed the prescribed dose   If you do exceed the prescribed dose, or in the event of an overdose, avoid the intake of carbohydrate-containing food or drinks and seek medical advice.  Exceeding the correct dosage may cause diarrhoea and other intestinal symptoms such as flatulence (wind) and abdominal cramps.     What should I do if I miss one or more doses?   If you forget to take one or more doses of Glucobay do not take the tablets between meals but, instead wait until your next scheduled dose and meal and continue as before.     What undesirable effects may I experience?   During the first few days or weeks of treatment with Glucobay you may experience increased flatulence (wind), a feeling of fullness and possibly abdominal cramps.  It is also possible that you may pass softer stools or even experience diarrhoea, particularly after a meal containing sugar or sucrose-containing foods. Normally, these symptoms will disappear if you continue treatment and keep to your prescribed diet.    Do not take indigestion (antacid) preparations for treating these symptoms as they are unlikely to have any beneficial effect.     If your symptoms persist for more than 2 or 3 days, or if they are severe consult your doctor, particularly in the case of diarrhoea.    Less common side-effects include inflammation of the liver (hepatitis), jaundice (yellowing of the skin) and skin reactions such as redness, rash and uticaria (hives).   Glucobay tablets may cause an increase in the results of certain liver function tests. These effects go away when treatment is stopped.    If you experience any other undesirable effects, tell your doctor immediately.      How should I store my Glucobay tablets?   It is best if you keep Glucobay tablets in the original carton supplied.  The tablets should be kept in a cool, dry place where the temperature is not likely to exceed 25ºC.     Keep out of the reach of children   Do not use tablets beyond the expiry date which is marked on both the outer container and on each blister strip of tablets. For example, EXP 2/99 means that your tablets must not be used after February 1999.   If you find that you have tablets after their expiry date, return them to your local pharmacist who will dispose of them properly.    Remember:   This medicine has been prescribed for you. Do not give it to anyone else under any circumstances.  If you have any doubts about taking Glucobay correctly seek the advice of your doctor.

"    Patient Information Leaflet   Please read this information carefully before taking Ciproxin tablets       What do my tablets contain?   Each tablet contains 250mg of the active ingredient ciprofloxacin.   Ciproxin tablets 250mg also contain maize starch, microcrystalline cellulose, crospovidone, colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose 2910, polyethylene glycol 4000 and the colouring agent titanium dioxide   The tablets come in packs of 10, 20 and 100, but your doctor will prescribe as many as you need.  However, your doctor may give you a starter pack containing two Ciproxin tablets to start your course of treatment.   The ciprofloxacin contained in Ciproxin is one of a group of antibiotics called quinolones which work by killing bacteria that cause infections.     Product Licence/Authorisation holder:   Manufacturer:    Bayer plc Pharmaceutical Division Bayer House Strawberry Hill Newbury, Berkshire RG14 1JA Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany    Why have I been prescribed Ciproxin tablets by my doctor?   Ciproxin tablets have been prescribed by your doctor to treat your bacterial infection.  Some of the infections which Ciproxin can be used to treat are:   Chest infections, e.g. bronchitis.   Infections of the urinary tract, e.g. cystitis.   Intestinal infections, e.g. infective diarrhoea.     When should I not take Ciproxin tablets?   Do not take Ciproxin tablets if you have previously had an allergic reaction to the active ingredient ciprofloxacin or any other quinolone antibiotics. If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor.   Generally, Ciproxin should not be given to children and adolescents unless considered essential by a doctor.  As with other antibiotics in this group, Ciproxin may cause pain and swelling in the developing joints of these patients.     What special precautions should I take?   If you are pregnant, planning a family or breast-feeding, tell your doctor before taking Ciproxin as it is not recommended for use under these conditions.  If you have already informed your doctor, follow his/her instructions carefully.   Providing you do not have a problem with your heart or kidneys, you should drink plenty of liquid whilst taking Ciproxin. Ciproxin may cause a problem with your kidneys called ""crystalluria"" which results in tiny crystals forming in the urine.  These crystals cannot be seen by the naked eye.  Drinking plenty of liquid can help prevent this occurring.  However, if you experience pain or discomfort when passing urine whilst you are taking Ciproxin, tell your doctor.   If you have a problem with your kidneys, tell your doctor before taking Ciproxin.  Your doctor may wish to change your dose to allow for any reduced kidney function.   If you have previously had ""fits"" or suffer from epilepsy or if you have ever suffered other conditions related to the nervous supply to the brain, tell your doctor before taking Ciproxin tablets.   Ciproxin may make you feel less alert, particularly when taken with alcohol.  Therefore, make sure you know how you react to Ciproxin before you drive or operate machinery. If in doubt, consult your doctor.   If you have a family history of or know that you have the hereditary condition G6PD, deficiency remind your doctor before taking Ciproxin.  This condition causes a deficiency of certain chemicals in the red blood cells and, if Ciproxin is taken, it may lead to the breaking down of red blood cells resulting in anaemia and yellowing of the skin (jaundice).   Ciproxin may occasionally cause pain and inflammation around your tendons particularly if you are elderly or taking one of a group of medicines called steroids such as hydrocortisone.  If you experience these symptoms, seek medical advice immediately and rest the affected limb.  Do not take the next dose of Ciproxin tablets unless your doctor tells you to.   Certain medicines are known to affect the action of Ciproxin and are best avoided whilst taking it.  Therefore, ask your doctor for advice if you wish to take antacids for indigestion or any other preparations containing aluminum, calcium, magnesium or iron whilst taking Ciproxin.  If these preparations are essential, they must not be taken within four hours of taking Ciproxin tablets.  If you take multivitamins or minerals, check that they do not contain iron, calcium or magnesium. If they do, your doctor may want you to stop taking them whilst you are taking Ciproxin.   Remind your doctor if you are taking drugs that thin the blood (anticoagulants) such as warfarin, or any medicines used to relieve pain and inflammation (e.g. fenbufen) except for aspirin.   If you are taking glibenclamide for diabetes, remind your doctor as Ciproxin sometimes increases the ability of glibenclamide to lower blood sugar and may result in hypoglycaemia (ie a ""hypo"").   Remind your doctor if you are taking probenecid or metoclopramide as these drugs may affect the level of Ciproxin in your blood.   If you are taking cyclosporin at the same time as Ciproxin, your doctor may want to take regular blood samples to monitor the level of a substance called creatinine in your blood.   If you take theophylline for asthma, remind your doctor as he/she may want to monitor the level of theophylline in your blood. This is particularly important if you suffer from ""fits"" or convulsions.    If you go into hospital for surgery, have dental treatment which requires an anaesthetic or you need to provide a blood or urine sample, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking Ciproxin tablets.      When and how do I take Ciproxin tablets?   The dosage of Ciproxin required and the duration of treatment depends upon the severity and type of your infection.   Take the tablets as prescribed by your doctor.  Usually this will be one tablet taken twice daily. The tablet(s) should be swallowed whole with a glass of water.  Drink several more glasses of water during every day of your treatment, unless told otherwise by your doctor.   Take the tablets for as long as directed by your doctor.  The usual duration of treatment is between 3 and 10 days, but it may be longer if your infection is more persistent or severe.  It is important that you complete the course of treatment, even if you begin to feel better after a few days.  If you stop taking this medicine too soon, your symptoms may return    Do not exceed the prescribed dose    If you take more than the prescribed dose, or in the event of an overdose, seek medical advice immediately and, if possible, take your tablets or the box with you to show the doctor.       What should I do if I forget to take my Ciproxin tablets?   Take your normal dose as soon as possible and then continue as prescribed.  However, if it is almost time for your next dose, do not take the missed dose and continue as usual, making sure that you complete your course of treatment.     What side-effects may I experience?   As can happen with some antibiotics, certain side-effects have been reported after Ciproxin.  You may experience diarrhoea, feeling sick (nausea), vomiting, indigestion, stomach-ache, wind, difficulty in swallowing, loss of appetite, headache, restlessness, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, skin rashes and itching.   Rarely, a disorder called pseudomembranous colitis can occur which causes attacks of diarrhoea containing blood and mucus.  Consult your doctor immediately if this occurs.   If you experience ""fits"", trembling, hallucinations, very severe headaches with visual disturbances, increased sleepiness, sleep disorders or feel anxious, confused or depressed, consult your doctor as soon as possible.   Rarely, people have experienced visual disturbances, impaired sense of taste and smell, ringing in the ears and, sometimes, impaired hearing which returns to normal once treatment with Ciproxin finishes.   Ciproxin may cause joint or tendon swelling with pain which may lead to tendon rupture.  If you experience these symptoms, seek medical advice immediately and rest the affected limb.  Do not take the next dose of Ciproxin tablets unless your doctor tells you to.  Ciproxin can also cause muscle pain.   As with all medicines, some people may be allergic to Ciproxin.  Usually, if you are allergic to Ciproxin, a reaction will occur soon after you start taking the tablets.  An allergic reaction can appear as a rash, hives, itching, small red spots on the skin or a fever.  Very rarely, an allergy to Ciproxin can cause swelling of the blood vessels in the skin and severe skin reactions such as large fluid-filled blisters, sores and ulceration.  Ulceration can also occur in the mouth and throat, around the anus and genital region and on the surface of the eyes.  These symptoms are often accompanied by sickness, headache and fever.    If you experience any of these symptoms, stop the treatment and seek medical advice immediately  .   The skin of some people may become more sensitive to the sun whilst taking Ciproxin.  Avoid too much sun and do not use a sun lamp until you know how you react when taking Ciproxin.  If in doubt, consult your doctor.   Ciproxin has been known to cause effects on the liver such as inflammation (hepatitis) and yellow jaundice.  It may also cause effects on the kidney which lead to pain and discomfort when passing water (crystalluria).  If you notice yellowing of your skin or any change in your urine output or appearance, possibly accompanied by kidney pain, seek medical advice immediately.  Ciproxin may affect certain components in the blood.  This may lead to bruising, jaundice, a persistent sore throat, fever with tiredness or a general feeling of being unwell.    If you experience any of these effects or any other undesirable effects, tell your doctor immediately.  Your doctor will give you advice.      How should I store my Ciproxin tablets?   No special precautions are required but it is best to keep Ciproxin tablets in the original box in a cool, dry place.    KEEP ALL MEDICINES OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN   Do not use tablets after the expiry date which is marked on both the outer carton and on each blister strip of tablets.  Wherever you see ""EXP"" this means ""expiry date"", for example, EXP 02/98 means that your tablets must not be used after February 1998.   If you find that you have tablets after their expiry date, return them to your local pharmacist (chemist) who will dispose of them properly.    Date of Preparation: May 1995    Remember: This medicine has been prescribed for you.  Do not give it to anyone else under any circumstances, even if they have the same condition as you.

The blue tablets each contain 2 milligrams of Estradiol (as hemihydrate) and 1 milligram of Estriol. These ingredients are both oestrogens.   The white tablets each contain 2 milligrams of Estradiol (as hemihydrate) and 1 milligram of Estriol plus 1 milligram of norethisterone acetate (a progestogen).   The red tablets each contain 1 milligram of Estradiol (as hemihydrate) and 0.5 milligram of Estriol.   The tablets also contain lactose, maize starch gelatin, talc, magnesium stearate, triacetin, E464 E171, E172, E132 and propylene glycol. The tablets do not contain any significant amounts of gluten. Trisequens is one of a group of hormone replacement therapies called cyclically-opposed HRT.    Product licence holder and manufacturer: Novo Nordisk A/S  , Novo Allé, DK-2880 Bagsvaerd, Denmark.     About Trisequens and hormone replacement therapy   Your doctor has prescribed Trisequens to relieve the unpleasant symptoms (such as hot flushes) which occur in many women around the time of the menopause. Trisequens may also have been prescribed to prevent the bone loss which can occur after this time, and which in some women can lead to fractures of the wrist, spine or hip in later life.     Important questions before taking Trisequens     Have you had cancer of the breast or endometrium (lining of the womb)?     Have you had any other cancer which may have been sensitive to oestrogens?     Do you have or are you being treated for phlebitis (inflamed veins), DVT (deep vein thrombosis), blood clots in the lung, or stroke?     Have you recently had any vaginal bleeding, other than during a period?     Do you suffer from liver problems, for example jaundice?     Do you suffer from heart or kidney disease?     Are you being treated with any lipid lowering drugs?     In any previous pregnancy did you suffer from severe itching, herpes, otosclerosis (loss of hearing) or jaundice?     Are you pregnant?     Are you allergic to any of the constituents? (These are listed above)     If you have answered   Yes   to any of these questions tell your doctor or pharmacist before starting Trisequens.     Precautions   Trisequens must be stopped at once if you become pregnant.   Ask your doctor for advice on whether you should stop taking the tablets if you need an operation or if you are confined to bed for a long time.   Your doctor will measure your blood pressure and carry out gynaecological and breast examinations at regular intervals, as appropriate for you.   It has been established that taking oestrogens alone increases the risk of endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the womb). Taking a progestogen in addition to the oestrogen lowers the additional risk.   Fibroids of the womb may increase in size during treatment. Tell your doctor if you notice any abdominal swelling whilst you are taking Trisequens.   There has been concern about the possible risk of breast cancer with oestrogen treatment. Many studies have not shown any increase in breast cancer, but some have shown a small increase after prolonged  treatment (5 years or longer). During treatment with Trisequens you should regularly self-examine your breasts. Your doctor will advise you if you need regular mammography; this may be necessary if you have, or have had, breast nodules or fibrocystic disease.   The risk of thrombosis (blood clots) is not known to be increased during treatment with Trisequens. However if a blood clot occurs during treatment, Trisequens should be stopped. You should stop taking the tablets and see your doctor if you experience any of the following: unusually severe or frequent headaches sudden visual disturbance, inflamed veins pain in the chest, swelling in the legs or arms breathlessness, pain on breathing.   You should stop taking Trisequens if you develop jaundice during treatment.   Trisequens has little effect on blood pressure. If you have had blood pressure before starting Trisequens you r doctor may want to measure your blood pressure more frequently. If you develop high blood pressure after starting taking Trisequens you should stop taking the tablets.   If you have a blood test remember to tell the doctor that you are taking Trisequens, since it may affect the result.     Trisequens and other diseases   Certain diseases are known to sometimes worsen during HRT and this can occasionally happen during treatment with Trisequens. If you suffer from heart or kidney disease, you will need more careful monitoring and your doctor will wish to see you more frequently.   If you have diabetes, your diabetic control may alter when you first start Trisequens - monitor your blood glucose more frequently during this time.     Contraception   It is important to note that Trisequens is not an oral contraceptive. If you are taking non-hormonal contraceptive precautions when you start Trisequens, you should continue to do so until your doctor tells you that contraceptive precautions are no longer required. If you have been taking a hormonal contraceptive (i.e. the pill or depot injections) you must change to a non-hormonal form of contraception before starting Trisequens.   If your doctor has already told you that you no longer need to take contraceptive precautions you need not do so whilst taking Trisequens.     Taking other medicines   If required other medicines can be taken together with Trisequens. However other oestrogen products should not be used unless prescribed by the same doctor specifically to be used with Trisequens. Remind your doctor if you are taking or start to take antidepressant drugs, or drugs for the treatment of epilepsy, since additional precautions may be necessary.   Taking mineral oil (liquid paraffin) with Trisequens may reduce its effect.     Taking your Trisequens   If you are still having periods take the first tablet on the fifth day of your period, whether your period has stopped or not. If your periods have stopped or become infrequent, the tablets can be started straight away; your doctor will let you know if this is the case.   Take one tablet a day, preferably at about the same time. Swallow the tablet with a glass of water. Begin by taking the blue tablets for 12 days followed by the white tablets for 10 days and finally the red tablets for 6 days.    Overdosage   The signs of overdosage are nausea and vomiting. Apart from treating these symptoms no other action is necessary.  continued        Missing a tablet   If you do forget to take your tablet at the usual time try and take it within the next twelve hours. Otherwise dispose of the forgotten tablet safely and start again as normal the next day. When you have finished one pack start the next immediately.     Bleeding with Trisequens   Whether you are still having periods or not, taking Trisequens will probably cause you to have regular bleeding during the red tablet phase or at the end of the white tablet phase. The amount of bleeding varies from woman to woman, but is not usually unduly heavy.   When treatment is first started, spotting or breakthrough bleeding can occur at other times in the tablet sequence. This normally disappears after continued treatment. However if it does occur you should let your doctor know, but it is not necessary to stop taking the tablets unless told to do so.     Possible side effects   During the first few months of treatment you may experience some breast tenderness or enlargement, and spotting or breakthrough bleeding can also occur. These side effects are usually temporary and normally disappear after continued treatment. Other side effects such as headache, oedema (water retention) or nausea seldom occur. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice any other unwanted side effect not mentioned above.     How to keep your tablets   The expiry date is printed on the calendar pack and outer carton: do not use the tablets after this date. Store the tablets at room temperature (below 25 C, but do not refrigerate) and keep them away from moisture. Protect them from light by keeping the calendar pack inside the box. Keep your tablets away from children.   If your doctor decides to stop the treatment, return any left over tablets to the pharmacist. Only keep your tablets if your doctor tells you to.    Date of leaflet preparation:   August 1995      The first tablet to be taken (blue) is under the sealed opening in the transparent outer rim of the calendar dial pack. Use your thumb nail to break the clear plastic tab, tip out your first tablet and swallow it whole.       Now use a coin on the centre to set the right day of the week against the empty space. You only need to do this once. If, at any time, you think you might have missed a days treatment, the calendar pack will show you on what day you took your last tablet.      Every day simply move the transparent outer rim one space in the direction of the arrow, and tip out the next tablet. The transparent dial can only be turned after the tablet under the opening has been removed. After four weeks it time to start a new pack.       ",

"       PLEASE READ THIS LEAFLET CAREFULLY    BEFORE YOU START YOUR TREATMENT.     IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR ARE NOT SURE ABOUT SOMETHING IN THIS LEAFLET, ASK YOUR DOCTOR OR PHARMACIST (CHEMIST)       CANESTEN 100MG PESSARY   WHAT DO CANESTEN 100MG PESSARIES CONTAIN?   Each pessary contains 100mg of the active ingredient clotrimazole .   The other ingredients are lactose, maize starch, adipic acid, sodium bicarbonate, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, silicon dioxide and polysorbate .   There are 6 peassaries and an applicator in a box.   Canesten  Pessaries contain clotrimazole.   This is one of a group of medicines called imidazoles which are used  to treat fungal infections such as thrush.    Product Licence holder:   Bayer plc Pharmaceuticals Division Bayer House, Strawberry Hill Newbury, Berkshire, RG14 1JA Manufacturer: Bayer AG Leverkusen, Germany      WHEN SHOULD I USE CANESTEN 100MG   PESSARIES?   The pessaries should be used to treat vaginal thrush .   Vaginal thrush (candidiasis) is a common infection caused by a fungus which may live harmlessly in the vagina without you even noticing it.  However, in certain circumstances it may develop into an infection in the vagina and the symptoms may spread to the surrounding area (the vulva).   The common symptoms of thrush are:     itching of the vagina and vulva     redness and swelling of the tissues of the vagina and vulva     soreness of the vagina     a white non-smelling discharge from the vagina     Not everybody who has thrush has all of these symptoms.  You may have only one of them.    If this is the first time you have had these symptoms, talk to your doctor before using any treatment.    WHEN SHOULD I NOT USE CANESTEN 100mg PESSARIES?   Do not use the pessaries  if you have previously had an allergic reaction to the active ingredient clotrimazole.  If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor or pharmacist.   See your doctor as soon as possible and   do not   use the pessaries if you have any of the following symptoms:     irregular vaginal bleeding     abnormal vaginal bleeding or a blood-stained discharge     ulcers, blisters, sores or pain of the vagina or vulva      lower abdominal pain     pain or difficulty in passing urine     fever or chills     feeling sick or vomiting     diarrhoea     a foul smelling discharge from the vagina     This is because Canesten 100mg Pessaries may not be the right treatment for you.    If you are unsure whether you have thrush, check with your doctor before using Canesten 100mg Pessaries.      WHAT SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS SHOULD I   TAKE?   If you are pregnant or are planning a family, tell your doctor or pharmacist before using Canesten Pessaries.  If you have informed your doctor or pharmacist already, follow their instructions carefully.   During pregnancy, extra care should be taken when using the applicator.   Before using the pessaries, you should see your doctor if:     you have had more than two infections in the last six months     you or your partner have ever had a sexually transmitted disease     you are aged under 16 or over 60 years     you have ever had an allergic reaction to Canesten or any other anti-fungal products.     WHEN AND HOW DO I USE CANESTEN 100MG PESSARIES?   The carton contains six Canesten 100mg Pessaries held inside a foil blister pack, and an applicator for insertion of the pessaries into the vagina.  This is a full course of treatment.  However, in the event that your symptoms persist upon completion of the course, see your doctor as he/she may recommend further treatment.   The applicator should be used to insert a pessary into the vagina before going to sleep on six consecutive nights. Alternatively, two pessaries may be inserted into the vagina before going to sleep on three consecutive nights.     00386028/5202/UK/1/965/og   Please follow the instructions below carefully:       Remove the applicator from the packaging.  Pull out plunger A until it stops.  Remove a pessary from the blister pack and place the pessary firmly into applicator B (Diagram 1).  To fit the pessary into the applicator, the holder of the applicator needs to be squeezed lightly at either side.  The pessary fits tightly into   the applicator and needs to be squeezed into the holder just far enough to be held in place during insertion (about 1cm).      Carefully put the applicator as deeply as is comfortable into the vagina (this is easiest when lying on your back with your knees bent up) (Diagram 2).    Holding the applicator in place, slowly press the plunger until it stops so that the pessary is deposited into the   vagina  .  Remove the applicator.   After use, remove plunger A completely by pulling it out of the applicator B.  Then wash it in warm (not boiling) soapy water, rinse and dry carefully (Diagram 3).    The symptoms of thrush such as burning, soreness or itching of the vagina and surrounding area should disappear within three days of treatment.  If no improvement is seen after 7 days, tell your doctor.    You can help prevent further infections if you follow these simple self-help tips:     Try to avoid wearing tight nylon knickers and close fitting jeans too often.  These provide warm and airless conditions which help the thrush fungus to grow.     Wash daily, but use simple, unperfumed soaps – not heavily scented or medicated ones.  Do not scrub hard with sponges or flannels, and avoid hot baths with strong perfumed oils or disinfectants.  The most soothing bath to have if you have thrush is a warm one with some salt in it.     After going to the toilet, do get into the habit of wiping yourself from front to back, as a thrush infection may easily be transferred from the bowel.     If you are still worried or have any further questions about the symptoms or the treatment, do not hesitate to ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice.   Canesten Pessaries should be used in the   vagina  only.  Do not put thme in your mouth or swallow them.  If you do swallow any pessaries accidentally, tell your doctor straight away or contact the Accident and Emergency Department of your nearest hospital.   WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I FORGET TO USE MY CANESTEN 100MG PESSARIES?   Canesten  Pessaries should be used for six   consecutive   nights if one pessary is used, or three consecutive nights if two pessaries are used.  However, if you forget to insert a pessary, follow the advice given below:   When you remember, continue with your course of treatment.  If you have forgotten for more than one day, your infection may not be fully treated, so if symptoms persist upon completion of this course, please arrange to see your doctor   If you forget to use the cream, apply it as soon as possible and then continue the rest of your treatment as usual.   WHAT SIDE-EFFECTS MAY I EXPERIENCE?   Rarely, Canesten 100 mg Pessaries  may cause side-effects in some people.  The side-effects are very similar to the symptoms of thrush.  If the redness, burning, irritation or swelling get worse, stop using the pessaries and see your doctor as soon as possible.    As with all medicines, some people may be allergic to the Canesten Pessaries.  Usually, if you are allergic to the pessaries, a reaction will occur soon after you start using it.  An allergic reaction may appear as a rash, nausea,  faintness or facial swelling.  If you experience any of these effects, tell your doctor Immediately.   If you feel you are reacting badly to this medicine in any other way, speak to your doctor or pharmacist.   HOW SHOULD I STORE MY CANESTEN 100MG PESSARIES?   No special precautions are required but it is best to keep the pessaries in the original carton in a cool, dry place.    Keep out of the reach of children   Do not use the pessaries or cream after their expiry date.  This will be printed at one end of the carton, on the end of the tube of cream and on the foil blister strip of the pessaries.  Wherever you see ""EXP"" this means ""expiry date"".  For example, EXP 12/99  means that your pessaries must not be used after December 1999.

Before taking your medicine     Have you ever had treatment for a breast lump, or any serious disease of your womb?     Do you have any liver, kidney or heart disease?     Are you being treated for thrombosis (blood clot) of any kind?     Have you had any bleeding between periods or since your last period, if your periods have stopped?

If you have taken HRT for 5 years you should discuss the continuation of HRT with your doctor.       Taking your medicine     Always use all your patches in the correct order as directed by your doctor.     If your periods have stopped or become very irregular, you can start using Estracombi TTS at any time.  Otherwise, start using Estracombi TTS within 5 days of the start of your next period.     The patches should be changed every 3 to 4 days.  You may find it helpful to tick the box on the inside cover of the wallet for the day of the week when you apply your first patch.  This then shows the two days each week when you should change your patch.     For   weeks 1 and 2   you should use the   Estraderm TTS 50   patches.     For   weeks 3 and 4   you should use the   Estragest TTS   patches.     It is important that you use all the Estraderm TTS 50 patches followed by all the Estragest TTS patches in the correct order each month.  If, for any reason, a patch becomes unusable or you lose it, use a fresh patch of the   same sort  , preferably taken from a spare pack.  You should then keep this pack as a spare pack until its expiry date.  If this is not possible or leaves you without adequate supplies, contact your doctor.     You may find that you have some irregular bleeding or spotting during the first month or so of treatment.  Once your treatment has become settled, you will probably have a period' each month starting during Week 4, shortly before you finish an Estracombi TTS pack.  This is quite normal.  If, however, you continue to have irregular bleeding or spotting, tell your doctor.     When you finish an Estracombi TTS pack, start the next pack straightaway.  There is no need to have a break between packs.       Putting on a patch     Remove one sachet from the box and tear it open at the notch.  Use your fingers because cutting with scissors might damage the patch inside.  You must never cut or tear your patches in any way.     Take out the transparent patch and loosen the backing by rubbing the edge of the patch between your thumb and forefinger.  The stiff protective liner will peel away from the flexible, sticky patch.     Stick the patch onto a hairless area of skin below the waist.  Most patients find that the buttock is the best place and that skin irritation is less likely to occur at this site.  You could also try the lower back, hip, abdomen or upper thigh  .  Never put a patch on or near the breasts  .  Choose a clean, dry area of skin. Avoid skin which is red or irritated. Never powder or oil your skin before putting on a patch as it may not stick properly.     Place the sticky patch on the area of skin you have chosen and press it firmly into position with the palm of your hand.  Pressing for 10-20 seconds or so will make it stick securely.  Run your finger around the edge of the patch to make sure that the edges stick.  Provided that you have applied the patch correctly, you can bath, shower or swim with little risk of the patch coming off.     If the patch does come off in the bath or shower, just shake it to remove any water, dry the skin thoroughly and put it on again in the usual way.     When the time comes to change your patch, take off the old one, fold it in half with the sticky side inwards, and throw it away carefully out of the reach of children.  Remember, it will still contain some medication.      Always place your new patch on a fresh area of skin.      If you forget to change the patch at the right time, you should change it as soon as possible. Then change to your next patch on the normal day.       After taking your medicine   These patches may sometimes cause unwanted effects in some people.  You are unlikely to get any of the following but, if you do, tell your doctor at once.     difficulty in breathing     general swelling or itching occurring outside the site of patch application     tender or painful veins or calves     yellowing of your skin or eyes     Other effects which may occur include:     Headaches, nausea or breast tenderness     Cramping pains in calf     Feeling slightly bloated     Slight redness and itching of the skin where a patch has been.

This is one of the group of medicines called   nitrates, which help to relieve the symptoms of angina.   Angina means a painful tightness ""in the chest"".  This is a good description of a typical attack, although the pain may also be felt in the arm or neck.  The pain really comes from the heart muscle and is a sign that part of it is not getting enough oxygen for the amount of work it has to do.   Transiderm Nitro is an adhesive patch containing a supply of glyceryl trinitrate which it releases through the skin and into the blood vessels. The diagram alongside shows how it works.      (Diagram A)    Things to remember about Transiderm Nitro     Instructions for using these patches are on the back of this leaflet, please read them carefully.

Place the sticky side of the patch on the clean skin, press firmly while you count slowly up to five.          6/7 Run your finger around the edge of the patch to make sure no air or water can get in. If you have applied the patch correctly you can bathe, shower or swim with little risk of the patch coming off.     Changing your patch     Your doctor will advise you about when to change your patch.  You would normally apply a new patch at roughly the same time each day.  You may be advised to wear each patch either for 24 hours, or for only part of each day.  Dispose of the old patch carefully, as it will still contain some active medication.  Apply the new patch to a different area of clean, dry skin.     If you forget to change your patch, put on a new one as soon as you remember. Then go on as before.

"    Q.Do I continue the treatment if I have my period?   A.Yes. Do not interrupt the course of treatment. Continue until the prescribed course is finished.    Q.Should I continue to have sex?   A.It is not a good idea to have sex while you have a thrush infection as it is easily transmitted to your sexual partner who might in turn give it back to you. Also Ecostatin can damage the rubber of contraceptive diaphragms and condoms (sheaths) so that they are no longer safe to use.     Q.What if I miss a dose?   A.If you miss the dose insert a pessary or apply the cream whichever has been forgotten as soon as you do remember.     INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSERTING THE PESSARY        LOADING THE APPLICATOR     Pull the plunger out about one inch.     Remove pessary from plastic wrapping.     Place the pessary into the cup end of the applicator.     Insert one pessary high into the vagina.       INSERTING THE APPLICATOR             Lie down on your back with your knees bent.     Insert the open end of the applicator into the vagina as far as it will comfortably go.     Hold the outer part of applicator in position and press plunger slowly with forefinger until the pessary is pushed out from the applicator into the vagina.     Withdraw the applicator from the vagina.       CLEANING THE APPLICATOR             Remove the plunger from the barrel by pulling it right out.     Wash both sections thoroughly under a stream of water allowing water to run through the barrel.     It is not necessary to sterilise the applicator. Do not use extremely hot water because it may soften the plastic     Dry the applicator and store in a clean place.          AVOIDING RE-INFECTION:     After passing water the toilet tissue should be used as a blotter rather than with a forward and backward motion. After bowel movement, the toilet tissue should be wiped in the direction away from the vagina in order to avoid the possibility of spreading infection from the back passage to the vagina.     Towels and underwear should be changed daily.     Your sexual partner should be treated at the same time as you using Ecostatin cream applied twice daily to the external genital area during the treatment period.       UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS:     Q.Are there any unwanted effects from Ecostatin?   A.Occasionally side effects similar to the symptoms of thrush occur (i.e. burning or irritation); this does not usually last long and disappears as the treatment is continued. If your symptoms get worse check with your doctor.     LOOKING AFTER YOUR MEDICINE:   You will see a ‘Use before’ date on the outer packaging of Ecostatin Twin Pack. Do not use after this date. Keep the pessaries and cream in a locked cabinet OUT OF CHILDREN’S REACH. The pessaries and cream should be stored below 25°C. Do not leave near a radiator on a window sill or in the bathroom. If your doctor decides to stop the medicine return any unused pessaries and cream to your pharmacist.    DATE OF PREPARATION:  March 1995    E.R.

"    Capsules      Please read this carefully before starting treatment.     If you have any doubts or worries, or you are simply not sure about something, consult your doctor  If you have any doubts or worries, or you are simply not sure about something, consult your    Questions you should ask yourself before taking Retrovir:     Have you previously experienced an allergic reaction to zidovudine?     Do you suffer from any blood disorder, eg anaemia?     Are you currently taking, or likely to be taking, any other medicines, including remedies you can buy yourself such as paracetamol, aspirin or codeine?     Are you pregnant, trying to become pregnant or breast-feeding?     Do you suffer from liver or kidney disease?     If the answer is YES to any of these questions, and if you have not already discussed them with your doctor, go back to him BEFORE starting treatment.    What is Retrovir treatment and how does it work?   Retrovir is the brand name for the drug zidovudine, sometimes known as AZT. It belongs to a group of medicines called antivirals. It is used to delay the progression of HIV infection. In order to understand how Retrovir works, it will help you to know how HIV multiplies within the body.   HIV reproduces itself by entering CD4 cells and turning them into 'mini factories' producing more viruses which, in turn, infect more cells. If this process goes untreated, eventually there are too few CD4 cells left to fight off diseases and infections - a condition which usually leads to AIDS.   Retrovir does not kill HIV, but works by entering the CD4 cells infected with it, helping to stop the production of new viruses and their despatch to other cells. Retrovir therefore helps to preserve your ability to resist disease by helping to prevent further deterioration of the immune system.     Taking your medicine     It is important to take your medicine as directed by your doctor. The label should tell you how much to take and how often. If you're not absolutely sure, consult your doctor.     The dose prescribed will vary from patient to patient and will depend on a number of factors, including the stage of infection. In practice a total daily quantity of between 500mg and 1000mg is usually prescribed divided into appropriate doses     The capsules should be swallowed whole with some water.     If you forget to take a dose, don't worry. Simply take it as soon as you remember and then continue as before.     If you think you may have difficulty in remembering to take your capsules at the times specified, it’s a good idea to use a pocket timer or wrist-watch alarm to remind you.     Whilst accidentally taking a larger dose than prescribed is not likely to cause any untoward effect, you should let your doctor know as soon as possible in such a situation.      Because your medicine controls and does not cure your condition, you will normally need to take it continually. You should not stop treatment unless your doctor tells you to.      Remember that treatment with Retrovir does not reduce the risk of passing HIV on to others by sexual contact or blood transfer, so you will remain infectious whilst taking the capsules       After taking your medicine     Retrovir is normally well tolerated, particularly by patients with early HIV infection. However, because of the way it works, it may sometimes cause side effects of which there are two main types, as follows;       The first can occur during the first 4 to 5 weeks of treatment and consists of nausea, vomiting and headache. Very rarely, muscular aches and a rash may also develop. In the vast majority of cases, all these effects disappear on their own after a few weeks, a fact worth bearing in mind if you experience them. Check with your doctor if they do not go away or become distressing.     The second can develop after four to six weeks of treatment and affects your bone marrovv's production of blood cells. Most commonly, production of red blood cells is reduced, resulting in anaemia. If this happens, the symptoms are tiredness and shortness of breath. Also, less commonly, the production of a type of white blood cell may be reduced which can make you more prone to infections. Studies have shown that these side effects occur in 5% or less of patients being treated for early HIV infection.       These effects are generally reversible and it is important to note that, with the lower treatment doses currently being prescribed, anaemia is now less common than when Retrovir was first introduced.     If you experience either type of the side effects associated with Retrovir, consult your doctor. He is likely to either reduce your dose or temporarily interrupt your treatment, usually for between two and four weeks, in order to allow your blood time to recover.       Can I take other medication whilst on treatment?     You can assume that any medication prescribed by a doctor who has full knowledge of your condition and treatment will be safe to take along with Retrovir.     In fact, as pan of your treatment, your doctor may offer you other medication to treat or prevent the opportunistic infections that may occur.     Problems can arise with medication that has not been prescribed by your doctor but which you may be in the habit of using or consider taking.     Taking any of these medications, eg paracetamol, along with Retrovir, without your doctor's knowledge may be harmful. This is because some preparations can interact adversely with Retrovir and make side effects worse if taken at the same time.     However, few adverse reactions have been noted by patients who take vitamin supplements, herbal remedies or homeopathic medicines, so if you feel benefit from these, continue taking them but keep your doctor informed.       Is it safe to drink alcohol whilst on treatment?     Alcohol can affect your response to many medications and you should discuss this matter in more detail with your doctor who will be familiar with your own particular case. Remember that excess alcohol in general can affect your overall health.       What about Retrovir in pregnancy?    The effects of Retrovir in pregnancy are not yet known. It is also not known if it is present in breast milk. HIV positive women who become pregnant, who are thinking of having a child or who are breast feeding should always consult their doctor      Is there anything else I should know?     It is important to understand that Retrovir can delay and slow down the progression of HIV infection, but you must be aware of the possibility of eventually developing symptomatic infection.     Resistance of the virus to Retrovir has been shown in a number of people and is more frequent in those with symptomatic infection. The importance of this in the overall future progression of the virus is not at present known.       Storing your medicine     Keep your capsules in a cool, dry, dark place and out of the reach of children.     If your doctor decides to stop and not restart your treatment, return any left over capsules to your pharmacist for disposal. Only keep them if your doctor tells you to.

"      Progynova TS   This booklet gives you some information about Progynova TS. Further advice is available from your doctor or pharmacist.   Progynova TS is used to replace the hormone, oestrogen, which is lost during the ""change of life"". Such treatments are known as ""oestrogen replacement therapy.""   The reason why you can only get Progynova TS with a doctor's prescription is that its use needs medical supervision.   Please ask your doctor if you have any doubts or worries about using Progynova TS, either before you start or while you are using it.    What the ""change of life"" and the ""menopause"" mean   ""The change of life"" (also known as ""the climacteric"") is a gradual process which usually takes place between the ages of about 45 and 55. The periods usually become irregular, both in timing and amount of bleeding, before they stop altogether.   However, the time at which the periods finally stop - ""the menopause"" - is not the end of the ""change of life"", which always continues for some time afterwards. Although the ""the change of life"" is natural, it often causes distressing symptoms due to the gradual loss of the female hormone, oestrogen, produced by the ovaries.    How Progynova TS helps you during the ""change of life""    Progynova TS contains an oestrogen which is absorbed through the skin and into the bloodstream. It can therefore relieve the symptoms caused by the loss of your own oestrogen.   Because it only contains one of the female sex hormones, Progynova TS is not suitable to be used alone for women who have not previously had a hysterectomy. Extra hormone treatment will be needed as well as Progynova TS if this is the case. Your doctor will be able to advise you about this.   The rest of the booklet contains full information about Progynova TS and its use. You should read this information carefully and, if you have any questions about it, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.    The name of your treatment is:   Progynova TS.    Active ingredient:   oestradiol (estradiol) (an oestrogen ) .   Progynova TS is a patch with an area of 12.5 square centimetres containing 3.9 milligrams of oestradiol (estradiol).    Inactive ingredients:   ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, glycerol monolaurate and an acrylate copolymer adhesive.   Each sealed pouch contains one Progynova TS patch .   Progynova TS is a form of oestrogen replacement therapy.    The Product Licence for Progynova TS is held by:   Schering Health Care Limited, The Brow, Burgess Hill, West Sussex RH15 9NE.    Progynova TS is manufactured by:   3M Pharmaceuticals, 3M Center, St Paul MN 55144 1000, USA.    Uses   Oestrogen replacement therapy for the treatment of symptoms associated with the menopause.     Reasons for not using Progynova TS   You must not use Progynova TS if you have any of the following: a pregnancy, if you are breast-feeding, abnormal red blood cells (sickle cell anaemia) or a past or present history of the following conditions:    clots in the blood vessels (thrombotic disorders) cancers of the breast, ovaries or womb (mammary ovarian or endometrial carcinoma). Other reasons for not using Progynova TS are bleeding from the vagina where no cause is known, a history during pregnancy of (1) itching of the whole body (pruritus of pregnancy), (2) the blister-like rash known as herpes gestationis, (3) worsening of inherited deafness (otosclerosis) or (4) jaundice not explained by infections, poisons or obstruction of the flow of bile (idiopathic jaundice of pregnancy), other types of idiopathic jaundice (Dubin-Johnson or Rotor syndromes),severe heart disease, severe kidney disease, severe disturbances of liver function (including the rare inherited disorder porphyria), previous or existing liver tumours, high blood fats (disturbances of lipid metabolism), severe diabetes affecting the blood vessels, tissue from the womb present in the wrong place (endometriosis), if you have an allergy to any of the ingredients.     What you should know before using Progynova TS   Some medical conditions may worsen during oestrogen therapy and require careful observation during treatment, e.g. epilepsy (fits), multiple sclerosis, diabetes, varicose veins, high blood pressure, heart, liver and kidney disease, migraine, asthma, lumpy or painful breasts (benign breast disease),tetany, abnormal limb movements (chorea minor) and inherited deafness (otosclerosis).   Your doctor will carry out gynaecological, blood pressure and other examinations as appropriate both before you start and at least every 6 months during your treatment.   Your doctor will examine your breasts periodically during treatment particularly if there is a history of breast cancer in your family.   It is important that you examine your breasts regularly and tell your doctor if you notice any changes in them.   The risk of gall bladder disease is slightly increased in women taking HRT.   If you continue to get red and itchy skin where the patches have been, talk to your doctor.   If you experience bleeding at unexpected times, talk to your doctor as this may need to be investigated.   During or after the use of hormones such as are contained in Progynova TS, benign liver tumours have rarely occurred, and even more rarely malignant liver tumours. In isolated cases, bleeding from such tumours into the abdominal cavity has endangered life. Although such events are extremely improbable you should inform your doctor about any unusual feelings in your upper abdomen that do not disappear within a short time.     If you are taking other medicines   Some drugs e.g. antibiotics and anti-epileptics, may reduce the effectiveness of Progynova TS. If you have to take any other medicines regularly you should inform your doctor.   If you are diabetic your doctor may alter the dose of medicine required to treat your diabetes.   Other oestrogen products should not be used unless the same doctor has prescribed them for use with Progynova TS.   The use of hormone replacement therapy may affect the results of certain laboratory tests. Always tell your doctor or the laboratory staff that you are using hormone replacement therapy.     Special warnings   Oestrogen treatments such as Progynova TS should not be used alone in women who have not previously had a hysterectomy. If you are using Progynova TS and have not had a hysterectomy you will need additional hormone treatment. Your doctor will advise you about this.   Progynova TS is not a contraceptive. Your doctor will be able to advise you about your need for contraception and a suitable method, if appropriate.      Reasons for stopping Progynova TS immediately   You should stop treatment (remove the patch) at once end consult your doctor if you have any of the following: your very first attack of migraine (typically a throbbing headache and nausea preceded by visual disturbances); worsening of pre-existing migraine, any unusually frequent or unusually severe headaches, sudden disturbances of vision or hearing, inflamed veins (phlebitis), swelling of the limbs, pain, tingling or numbness in any part of the body, unexplained cough, breathlessness, pain on breath   Progynova TS must also be stopped at once if you become pregnant, if you develop jaundice, cholestasis (a problem with bile), hepatitis (inflammation of the liver) or pruritus (itching of the whole body), if your doctor finds a significant rise in your blood pressure or an increase in size of existing fibroids of the womb, or if you notice an increase in epileptic seizures.   Ask your doctor for advice on whether you should stop Progynova TS if you are confined to bed, or have an accident or illness, or you need an operation.     How to use Progynova TS   If you are not currently taking hormone treatment you can start to use Progynova TS immediately.   If you are already using another type of hormone treatment, start Progynova TS the day after stopping your treatment or when your doctor has told you to.     To apply Progynova TS   The patch should be applied to a clean, dry area of skin preferably on the stomach or buttocks. Progynova TS must not be applied on or near the breasts. The area chosen should not be oily, damaged or irritated, and the waistline should be avoided since tight clothing may rub the patch off.   Take the patch out of its packaging. Remove the protective liner. The patch should then immediately be pressed firmly in place with the palm of the hand for about 10 seconds. Make sure there is good contact with the skin, especially around the edges.   The patch should be left in place for 7 days, then removed and replaced with a new patch which should be applied to a different area.   If a patch falls off before 7 days are up, it may be reapplied. If necessary a new patch may be used if it is not possible to reattach the old patch properly. If a new patch is used it should then be kept on for the full 7 days.   Although the patches should usually be applied continuously, your doctor may tell you to apply the patches on a cyclical basis. In this case, a patch should be applied weekly for 3 weeks followed by a 7-dayinterval without a patch application before the next course.     Overdosage   In the unlikely event of overdosage, nausea and vomiting may occur. There may be some bleeding from the vagina after the patch is removed. No specific treatment is necessary but you should consult your doctor if you are concerned.     Possible side effects   In some patients the use of Progynova TS may cause some irritation of the skin at the site of application. During the first few months of treatment you may experience some vaginal bleeding at unexpected times (breakthrough bleeding and spotting) and some breast tenderness or enlargement. These are usually temporary and normally disappear with continued treatment. Other occasional side effects may include: nausea, abdominal pain, a sensation of bloating, increased skin pigment especially on the face (chloasma), other skin rashes, growth of existing fibroids, headache, migraine, dizziness, anxiety or depressive moods, rise or fall in weight, fluid retention, high blood pressure, changes in vaginal secretion, altered sex drive.   Tell your doctor if you have any of these symptoms, or indeed any other new symptoms during treatment.   Substances such as are contained in Progynova TS may cause jaundice in people who have an inherited abnormality of bile excretion.     Expiry date   The expiry date for this pack of Progynova TS is shown on the box. The patches must not be used after this date.

The product licence is held by:   Organon Laboratories Ltd, Science Park, Cambridge CB4 4FL.    Ovestin Cream is made by:   Organon (Ireland) Ltd, Drynham Road, Dublin, Ireland.     What is Ovestin Cream used for?   Ovestin Cream is used to treat vaginal complaints that are caused by having too little oestrogen.   It can also be used before or after vaginal surgery.     Before you use the cream     Do you think you may be pregnant?     Are you breast-feeding?     Have you had a thrombosis (a blood clot)?     Have you had tumours of the breast or other sex organs?     Have you had unexplained vaginal bleeding?     Have you had liver disease (such as Rotor syndrome or Dubin-Johnson syndrome) or jaundice when you were pregnant?     Do you have porphyria (a metabolic disorder)?     Do you have a heart or circulation disease?     Do you have too much cholesterol or other fatty substances in the blood?     During pregnancy or while taking steroids have you had a skin rash (herpes gestationis), severe itching or a hearing problem?     If the answer to any of these questions is YES:      Did you tell your doctor at the last visit or an earlier visit?      If you did NOT then you should do so as soon as possible and before using the cream.     Even so, your doctor may still want you to use it.     What do I need to know before using my medicine?   If you have a vaginal infection, your doctor may also prescribe a medicine to treat the infection.   While you are taking Ovestin Cream regular medical checks by a doctor are recommended. Sometimes a tissue examination (cervical smear) will be necessary.   Your doctor may want you to stop using the cream from time to time to check if you still need to use it. Using oestrogens for a very long time may increase the chance of tumours of the lining of the womb very slightly.   If you are having an operation (apart from a vaginal operation) you should stop using the cream about 6 weeks before. Don't start using the cream again until you are fully mobile.    Extra supervision   by your doctor may be necessary in some cases.   Tell your doctor if you have ever had:     a disease of the heart or circulation     high blood pressure     migraine headaches; - epilepsy; - liver disease such as jaundice; - kidney disease; - endometriosis (a disorder of the womb lining);      lumps in the breast     diabetes.       What other medicines are you taking?   Other medicines may affect how Ovestin Cream works or it may affect how they work. Tell your doctor if you are taking (or intend to take) any other medicines.     How do I use Ovestin Cream?   It is important to use this medicine only as directed by your doctor or pharmacist.     How much   For   vaginal complaints   the usual dose is 1 applicator dose (0.5 mg oestriol in 0.5 g of cream) a day for the first 2 to 3 weeks. Then the dose is 1 applicator-dose twice a week.   Your doctor may want you to stop from time to time (every 2 to 3 months), to check if you still need treatment.   Before   vaginal surgery   the dose is 1 applicator-dose (0.5 mg oestriol in 0.5 g of cream) a day for 2 weeks before the operation. After the operation do not use the cream again for at least 2 weeks.   Keep using this medicine as prescribed by your doctor. Do not stop just because you seem to be better. If you stop too early or too suddenly your complaints may return.     How to apply the cream   Use the applicator to apply the cream in the vagina. It as a good idea to do this before going to bed.   One application contains 0.5 mg of oestriol.     Remove cap from the tube, invert it, and use the sharp point to open the tube.     Screw the end of the applicator onto the tube.     Squeeze tube to fill the applicator with the cream until the plunger stops (at the ring mark).     Unscrew applicator from tube and replace cap on tube.     To apply the cream, lie down, insert the end of the applicator deep into the vagina and slowly push plunger all the way in.     After use, pull plunger out of barrel and wash both in warm, soapy water. Do not use detergents. Rinse well afterwards.   DO NOT  PUT THE APPLICATOR IN HOT OR BOILING WATER.    What to do if Ovestin Cream is swallowed accidentally or if too much is taken at one time    If someone has swallowed some cream by accident, or too much cream is applied at any time, there is no need to worry. However, you should consult a doctor. The person may feel sick or be sick. Women may have some vaginal bleeding after a few days.     What if I miss a dose?   Apply the missed dose when you remember, unless you are more than 12 hours late. If you are more than 12 hours late just skip the missed dose.     What about side-effects?   Ovestin Cream sometimes causes side effects in some people.     These usually settle down during treatment as the body adjusts to the medicine.     If you have any of these side effects, tell your doctor. He may decide to stop your treatment for a while.     When you start to use the cream you may have irritation or itching. Sometimes the breasts become swollen, tender or painful. Tell your doctor if vaginal bleeding occurs. Tell your doctor about any problems that you think might be caused by the cream.     How should you store this medicine?   Do not use this medicine after the ""use by"" date on the pack.   Store the cream at room temperature (15-25C). Keep the cream in the original box where children cannot see or reach it.   This information was written in September 1995.     More about Ovestin Cream   Ovestin Cream contains oestriol, one of the natural female sex hormones (oestrogens or estrogens).     Oestrogens are produced in the ovaries. They cause sexual development in women and control the menstrual cycle during the childbearing years. When women get older the ovaries gradually produce less oestrogen. This happens at the menopause (usually around the age of 50). If the ovaries are removed surgically (ovariectomy) before the menopause, oestrogen production stops very suddenly.   Shortage of oestrogens may cause the vaginal wall to become thin and dry. So sexual intercourse may become painful and vaginal infections may occur.   These complaints can be relieved by using medicines containing oestrogen. However it may take several days or weeks before you notice an Improvement.   Ovestin cream may also be prescribed to help wound healing after vaginal surgery. Unlike most oestrogens, oestriol has little effect on the inner lining  of the womb. So Ovestin Cream usually does not cause vaginal bleeding.   Ovestin cream is easy to remove with water.     General things to remember about medicines     This medicine has been prescribed for your current medical problem. Do not use it for other medical problems.     Do not allow other people to use your medicines and do not use medicines meant for other people.     Tell any doctor treating you what medicines you are taking.

"      WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT   Please read this leaflet carefully before you start to take this medicine, even if you have taken   SANDIMMUN   Oral Solution before. You will notice that the advice contained in this leaflet may vary depending on whether you are receiving the drug for transplantation or taking it for your skin condition or as treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. If you have any questions or are unsure about anything, ask your doctor or pharmacist (chemist) for advice.    WHAT'S IN YOUR MEDICINE   SANDIMMUN Oral Solution is a yellow or brownish-yellow, oily liquid, containing 100mg cyclosporin per ml.   It also contains the followings inactive ingredients: absolute ethanol and maize oil.    SANDIMMUN   Oral Solution is available in 50ml bottles.   The name of your medicine is   SANDIMMUN   and it contains cyclosporin. It is one of a group of drugs known as immunosuppressive agents. These drugs are used to dampen down the body’s immune reactions.    SANDIMMUN   Oral Solution is manufactured for:SANDOZ PHARMACEUTICALSby:SANDOZ PHARMA AG SANDOZ Pharmaceuticals (UK) LtdCH-4002 Frimley Business ParkBaste Frimley, CamberleySwitzerland Surrey, GU16 5SG WHY DOES YOUR DOCTOR WANT YOU If you have received an organ or bone marrow transplant   Although you may have undergone a series of tests before your organ or bone marrow transplant to ensure that the match between your body and the transplanted organ or bone marrow was as close as possible, the donor tissue will still not be identical to your tissue. As a result, your body’s immune system will try to reject the donor tissue.   SANDIMMUN   helps to stop this rejection response by blocking the development of special cells which would normally attack the transplanted tissue.     If you have a severe skin complaint   Some skin conditions such as severe psoriasis or eczema (severe atopic dermatitis) are thought to be caused by your immune system over-reacting.   SANDIMMUN   may help to stop this by suppressing your immune system, thereby improving your skin condition.     If you have severe rheumatoid arthritis   It is thought that rheumatoid arthritis may be caused by inappropriate immune responses in your body.   SANDIMMUN   may help to stop this by suppressing your immune system, thereby improving your rheumatoid arthritis.       BEFORE USING YOUR MEDICINE   Tell your doctor before you start taking   SANDIMMUN   Oral Solution if the answer to any of the following questions is yes:     Do you suspect that you have had an allergic reaction to, or been upset by any of the ingredients in   SANDIMMUN   (listed in 'What’s in your medicine')?     Do you have any kidney problems or have you had any disease which may have affected your kidneys?     Do you have high blood pressure?     Do you have an infection of any type?     Have you been told that you have any kind of tumour?     Do you have any liver problems or have you had any disease which may have affected your liver?     Have you been told that you have high levels of potassium in your blood or that you have gout?     Do you have any skin conditions other than severe psoriasis or eczema?     Are you taking any other medicines (either bought or prescribed)?     Are you taking any other medicines (either bought or prescribed)?   Some medicines can interfere with your treatment, so make sure to check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking any other medicines. In particular, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following:     antibiotics or antifungal medicines for treatment of infections     oral contraceptive tablets     any medicines for heart problems or high blood pressure     anti-epileptic medicines     cholesterol lowering medicines     other immunosuppressive medicines (e.g. prednisolone)     sleeping tablets     potassium supplements     medicines to encourage urination     anti-inflammatory medicines (e.g. diclofenac)     light treatment for a skin condition     colchicine     Are you pregnant, or planning to become pregnant?

Has the medicine been prescribed for the treatment of severe rheumatoid arthritis in someone who is less than 18 years of age?     Has the medicine been prescribed for the treatment of severe rheumatoid arthritis in someone who is less than 18 years of age?     TAKING YOUR MEDICINE   Your doctor will work out the correct dose of   SANDIMMUN   for you depending on your body weight and whether you are taking   SANDIMMUN   following a transplant or as a treatment for severe psoriasis, eczema or rheumatoid arthritis. Your doctor will also tell you how often to take your medicine.   If you have had an organ or bone marrow transplant the total dose is usually within the range of 2mg/kg body weight per day and 15mg/kg body weight per day. Generally, the higher doses are used just after transplantation and the lower doses are used once your transplanted organ or bone marrow has stabilised. Your doctor will adjust your dose to one that is ideal for you. To do this, he may need to do some blood tests.   For the treatment of severe psoriasis and eczema the total dose is usually within the range of 2.5mg/kg body weight per day and 5mg/kg body weight per day.   For the treatment of severe rheumatoid arthritis, the total daily dose is usually within the range of 2.5mg/kg body weight per day and 4mg/kg body weight per day.   Your doctor will tell you how much   SANDIMMUN   to take and how long you will need to take   SANDIMMUN   for, depending on whether you are taking   SANDIMMUN   following transplantation, or for the treatment of a severe skin condition, or rheumatoid arthritis. For the treatment of severe eczema, treatment usually lasts for 8 weeks.     Follow your doctor's instructions exactly and never change the dose yourself, however well you feel.

The product licence of NIVAQUINE Syrup is held by: May & Baker Limited, Eastbourne, England BN21 3YG and the product authorisation by May & Baker Limited, Dagenham, England, RM10 7B. NIVAQUINE IS manufactured by: Rhône-Poulenc Rorer Pharma, St Genis Laval France.      Why has my child been given NIVAQUINE Syrup?   NIVAQUINE is usually given to help prevent your child getting malaria. Malaria is spread by mosquitos. Some mosquitos carry the malaria parasites and can infect your child with them if they bite your child - it can take up to a week or more to develop malaria after an infected bite . NIVAQUINE can help prevent your child getting malaria when your child has been bitten by a mosquito. Like other similar medicines, in some cases NIVAQUINE will not give complete protection against malaria. It is, therefore, important you follow all other medical advice.   Make sure that you have told your doctor or pharmacist which countries you are visiting. In some parts of the world the malaria parasites are not affected by chloroquine. If your child has been given another anti-malarial medicine to take with NIVAQUINE, then you must follow the separate directions for it.   Sometimes your doctor may have prescribed NIVAQUINE for treating other conditions. Please contact your doctor if this is the case.   If your child is already taking NIVAQUINE or medicines called ""Avloclor"" or ""PIaquenil"" for another condition consult your doctor.   Keep this leaflet for reference until your child has finished taking the medicine.     Before your child takes NIVAQUINE Syrup   If the answer is YES to any of the following questions you should discuss the matter with your doctor or pharmacist before your child takes any of the syrup.     Is your child taking any other medicine?     Does your child have any of the following illnesses - liver or kidney illness, epilepsy, psoriasis, blood disorders or neurological disorder?     Has your child ever had a severe or allergic reaction to NIVAQUINE or chloroquine on taking it before?     Even if you are breast feeding and taking NIVAQUINE this will not protect your baby against malaria. It is important that you discuss this with your doctor.     How should my child take NIVAQUINE Syrup?   It is very important that your child takes NIVAQUINE syrup properly. If your child does not take enough, he/she has a greater risk of developing malaria.    NIVAQUINE is a trade mark56/69/28      If your child takes too much, he/she may develop side effects     The dose for children depends on their weight     Weigh your child, preferably, in kilograms.     Use the table below to show the correct dose.     For example, if your child weighs 20 kg (about 3st 2lbs) the dose of NIVAQUINE Syrup is two x 5 ml spoonfuls ( 10 mls).     When the weight of your child lies between two weights on the table use the lower dose. For example, if your child weighs 25kg the correct dose is two x 5ml spoonfuls ( 10 mls) of NIVAQUINE syrup.     For doses less than 5ml your pharmacist can supply you with a syringe to measure out the NIVAQUINE syrup.     When you have worked out the dose, do it again to make sure you have done it properly.      Your child should take one full dose at one time. So. if the dose is three x 5ml spoonfuls, this should be taken all at once.     If possible. your child should start by taking the dose of syrup above, 1 week before entering a country where malaria may be present.      If your child cannot take NIVAQUINE Syrup before entering the country the dose should be taken on arrival.      The next dose of syrup is taken one week after the first dose. Don't worry if that seems a long time between doses. NIVAQUINE remains in the body for a long time.      Do not be tempted to give your child the syrup more often unless your Doctor or Pharmacist tells you to.      Your child should take the dose on the same day each week     If you will have a problem remembering to give the syrup to your child, ask a friend or a relative to remind you. Writing the day your child should take the dose in your diary or on a calendar may help jog your memory.      When your child arrives home he/she should continue to take the dose of syrup once a week for 4 weeks. You must remember to be sure that your child keeps taking the syrup when you are at home-even if your child feels perfectly well. Malaria can develop some time after being bitten by a mosquito. If your child stops taking the syrup this will increase the risk of developing malaria when you are at home.      If your child forgets to take the syrup, it must be taken immediately you remember and then continued as before.     If your doctor has prescribed another medicine to help prevent malaria your child may need to take this medicine more often than NIVAQUINE. Follow the instructions carefully.      If your child has to take NIVAQUINE for a long period of time, for example a year or more, consult your doctor who may decide to carry out a few simple test on your child.          What other measures must I take to reduce the risk of     developing Malaria?   Like other anti-malarial medicines, NIVAQUINE does not give guaranteed complete protection against malaria. Your child should also try to avoid being bitten by mosquitos by doing the following:-        Remember that the risks of being bitten by a mosquito are much greater in a rural, rather than a built-up area. You can reduce the risk of being bitten in a rural area by visiting only in the day, when mosquitos rarely bite.     Make sure your child wears long-sleeved clothing and long trousers after sunset, avoiding dark colours as these attract mosquitos     Make sure your child wears repellent-soaked wrist or ankle bands between dusk and dawn     If your accommodation is not protected against mosquitos by, for example, screened windows and doors and/or air conditioning then do the following     When entering a room at night use a fly killer spray to kill any mosquitos which have entered the room at night     Make sure your child always sleeps under a mosquito net Make sure that there are no holes in the net and that it is tucked in under the mattress. You can increase the effect of the net by soaking it in an insecticide such as permethrin     If you think mosquitos can enter your child's room at night, use an electric mosquito killer or bum a 'mosquito coil' Mosquito 'buzzers' are not effective Advice on the above can be obtained from your doctor or pharmacist before you leave home In the countries you are visiting you should obtain information and supplies from a local pharmacist In the UK further information and supplies can be obtained by telephoning the Medical Advisory Service for Travellers Abroad (MASTA) on 071 631 4408 The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine has a 24 hour recorded help line on 0891 600 350 and recorded advice on preventing mosquito bites on 0891 600 274 (calls are charged at 48p per minute at peak rate and 36p per minute at other times)       How can I tell if my child has developed Malaria?   If any of the following symptoms develop when you are away or within 1 year of arriving home:   High temperature with chills, shivering or sweating, Headache, diarrhoea, other 'flu-like' symptoms, or, if you have any concern about your child's health, you should contact a doctor.     What should I do if I think my child may have developed Malaria?     Immediately seek medical attention. Delay can be dangerous.     If your child has returned home visit your doctor immediately. It is very important that you tell your doctor that your child has recently returned from abroad. Tell your doctor which countries you have visited and what medicines your child has taken.     If you cannot see your usual doctor go immediately to the casualty department of your local hospital and tell them the above information.     The early stage of malaria is easily treated but delay in seeking medical attention can make It very difficult to treat and may be fatal.       What should I do if my child accidentally takes too much syrup?    If your child has taken too much syrup accidentally      Immediately tell your doctor or visit the nearest hospital casualty department      Emergency treatment may be required in such cases, as NIVAQUINE overdosage can be dangerous, especially in children     Do   not   use salt to make your child sick-it may make him worse.        Does NIVAQUINE Syrup have Side Effects?   As well as benefits most medicines may have unwanted effects in some people.    The following minor side effects on NIVAQUINE are well known. You need not worry about them unless they become troublesome:     headache     mild stomach upset Shortly after taking NIVAQUINE you child’s eyesight may become blurred. If your child is affected in this way, make sure that your child does not take part in unsupervised activities until this effect has disappeared - usually within 24 hours      The following are serious side-effects and you should tell your doctor or pharmacist about them immediately   skin trouble such as rash or itching psoriasis may worsen severe stomach upset blurred eyesight which lasts for more than 2 days convulsions loss of hair If they occur before you leave home your doctor or pharmacist may be able to recommend an alternative medicine    If your child has any problems which you think may be caused by NIVAQUINE see a doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible.      How should I store NIVAQUINE Syrup?     NIVAQUINE Syrup can be dangerous when not used correctly, especially to young children, and should be kept in a safe place     Keep the syrup in a cool place away from light     When your child has finished a course of treatment return any unused syrup to a pharmacist who will arrange for it to be destroyed. Do not give this medicine to others - it may be harmful to them       How can I tell if NIVAQUINE Syrup can still be used?     All medicines have an expiry date     The expiry date of NIVAQUINE Syrup is printed on the bottle label     The expiry date follows an 'EXP’ printed on the label. So ‘APR 95' means that the expiry date is April 1995.

"    Patient Information Leaflet on ‘Algitec' Chewtab (cimetidine/alginic acid) Tablets   This leaflet tells you about 'Algitec' Chewtab Tablets. Please read it before taking your tablets.   If there is anything you do not understand, or if you want to know more about your tablets, ask your doctor or pharmacist (chemist).   Please keep this leaflet. You may want to read it again.    What is in Algitec' Chewtab Tablets?   'Algitec' Chewtab Tablets contain the active ingredients cimetidine and alginic acid. Each tablet of 'Algitec' Chewtab contains 200 milligrammes (mg) of cimetidine and 500 mg of alginic acid (E400).   Your tablets also contain inactive ingredients. These are sodium bicarbonate (E500), Eudragit, sorbitol (E420), pregelatinised starch, croscarmellose sodium type A, lactose, aspartame, sodium saccharin, magnesium stearate (E572) and aniseed, butterscotch and peppermint flavours.   'Algitec' Chewtab Tablets contain 47 mg of sodium in each tablet.   Each pack contains 120 tablets in six tubes of 20.     Who makes Algitec?

'Algitec' Chewtab Tablets are manufactured by Smith Kline & French Laboratories Ltd., Manor Royal, Crawley.     What is 'Algitec' and how does it work?   'Algitec' is an antacid. If the acid from your stomach comes up into your gullet (reflux) it can cause pain and inflammation. 'Algitec' can help to treat this in two ways. In your stomach, the alginate (alginic acid) makes a frothy layer or raft which floats on the stomach contents and helps to prevent them coming up into your gullet. The cimetidine (which is a histamine H2 receptor antagonist) helps to reduce the amount of acid being produced in your stomach, so even it the contents get through the alginate ran, there is much less acid to cause any damage.     What are 'Algitec' Chewtab Tablets used for?   'Algitec' Chewtab Tablets are used for the treatment of heartburn and acid reflux.    Before taking your medicine   If you answer   YES   to any of the following questions   DO NOT   take this medicine. Go back to your doctor and ask what to do. You may need to be given another medicine or the dose may need to be changed.     Are you allergic to 'Algitec' (cimetidine or alginic acid)?     Do you have kidney problem?     Do you have a blood disease?     Are you pregnant or do you think you may be?     Are you breast feeding?     You should also tell your doctor before taking 'Algitec', if you are taking any of the following medicines:     Medicines which thin the blood (anticoagulants, e.g. warfarin)     Medicines to prevent fits (anticonvulsants, e.g. phenytoin)     Theophylline tablets to help your breathing     Lignocaine       Taking your medicine      How should you take your tablets?   Chew your tablets well before swallowing. Have a drink of water after the tablet if you need one. 'Algitec' is not suitable for children.     How much should you take and how often?   The usual dosage of 'Algitec' Chewtab Tablets is one tablet taken four times a day. Take the first tablet after breakfast, another one after your midday meal, the third tablet after your evening meal (or tea) and the fourth at bedtime.    50045G B2   Your doctor may increase the dose to two tablets four times a day if you do not start to feel better after taking the usual dose.   Doctors sometimes prescribe different doses to those given in this leaflet, if this applies to you, discuss it with your doctor if you have not already done so   The pharmacist's label on your pack will tell you how much your doctor would like you to take. Please read the label carefully.   Do not take more than your doctor has recommended.      How long should you carry on taking ‘Algitec'?   Keep taking your tablets until the prescribed course is finished. You may start to feel better after a few days, but do not stop taking the tablets. If you stop too soon your symptoms may come back.   You will usually be given enough tablets to last you for between four and eight weeks.     What if you miss a dose?   If you forget to take your tablet, miss out that dose completely. Take your next tablet at the normal time.     What if you have taken too much?   You should only take the dose that your doctor or pharmacist has told you. II you take too many tablets tell your doctor or hospital casualty department straight away. Take your tablet pack with you.    After taking your medicine      What unwanted effects might your tablets cause?   Side effects with your medicine are usually mild and do not last long. The most common unwanted effects are diarrhoea, dizziness, rash and tiredness.   Other more rare side effects are confusion, breast enlargement in men, blood changes, kidney disorders, liver disorders, inflammation of the pancreas, fever, headache, aching muscles, aching joints, heart effects and impotence. All these unwanted effects should disappear when treatment is stopped.   Very rarely allergic reactions (such as rash, itching, shortness of breath and low blood pressure) and hair loss have occurred     Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice any of these effects or any other unwanted effects not mentioned above.     Storing your tablets   Your tablets will have an expiry date on the pack. You should not use your tablets after this date.   Keep the tablets in their original pack, at room temperature (below 30°C).   Remember this medicine has been prescribed just for you. Never offer your medicine to other people. It may not be suitable for them even if their symptoms seem the same as yours.    Keep all  medicines out of the reach of children - preferably in a locked cupboard or medicine cabinet.      SELF HELP    What else can be done to reduce symptoms? IN ADDITION   to the prescribed course of 'Algitec', a number of practical measures can help.      Reduce weight   - If you are overweight, this can ""squeeze"" the stomach. A sensible weight-reducing diet will help to ease this pressure on the stomach and reduce reflux.      Meals   - Don't rush your food or eat in a 'hunched-up"" position. Eat regular, sensible meals. Try to avoid eating or drinking late at night or before you go to bed.      Smoking   - As well as the well-known dangers of smoking, it has been shown that smoking stops the valve-like muscle at the bottom of the gullet from working properly. Stopping smoking, or greatly cutting down, will help your reflux.      Sleeping   - When you are Iying down it is easier for the stomach contents to ""leak"" into the oesophagus (gullet) causing heartburn. Raising the head of your bed on wooden blocks or bricks can help a great deal .      Activity   - Try to avoid bending or stooping, whenever possible. Try to kneel instead and keep your back straight. Wear loose-fitting clothes if you can.

"    Percutaneous BCG Vaccine BP (Tub/Vac/BCG (Perc)) (High Strength BCG Vaccine)   PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY before your child is vaccinated.  This leaflet provides a summary of the information available on the vaccine.  If you have any questions or are not sure about anything, ask your doctor.   The name of this product is PERCUTANEOUS BCG VACCINE BP.  It is one of a group of medicines called vaccines, which are used to protect people against infectious diseases.    What is in the vaccine?   PERCUTANEOUS BCG Vaccine is a freeze-dried powder of a live, weakened strain of   Mycobactenum bovis   (the same type of bacteria that causes the infectious disease tuberculosis (TB), except that the weakened bacteria cannot cause the disease).  The powder is mixed with sterile water or sodium chloride solution before use.   When mixed with the sterile water or sodium chloride solution, each vial of the vaccine contains the equivalent of not less than 50 million units of the weakened strain of the bacteria.  The vaccine also contains dextran, glucose, Triton WR 1339 and water.   The vaccine is supplied as a freeze-dried powder in 10 dose containers (in packs of 10).     How does the vaccine work?   When your child is vaccinated with PERCUTANEOUS BCG Vaccine your child's body produces a response (called ""cell-mediated immunity"") against the weakened tuberculosis-causing bacteria.  If your child later comes into contact with TB, this same response will again be produced to protect your child so that he or she does not catch the disease.     The Product Licence Holder and Manufacturer are:   Evans Medical Limited, Regent Park, Leatherhead KT22 7PQ, England.     What is the vaccine used for?   PERCUTANEOUS BCG Vaccine is used to protect people against tuberculosis, a serious infectious disease which may affect any part of the body. The disease most commonly affects the lungs (chest). The vaccine is given to babies from birth and very young children.     Before your child receives his/her vaccination   Has your child had a skin test to check that they are not already immune to tuberculosis? (Anyone over 3 months old should have a skin test   before   BCG vaccination).   Has your child had Measles or German Measles recently? (This can affect the result of the skin test).   Do you think your child may be allergic/sensitive to any of the ingredients in the vaccine which are listed above?   Does your child feel feverish or does your child have any type of infection?   Is your child receiving any treatment that lowers their resistance to disease, for example, steroids, radiotherapy, or drugs used for treating cancer, or does your child have a medical condition that affects their resistance to infection (for instance, cancer leukaemia, HIV)?   Has your child had any other vaccinations in the last 3 weeks?   Does your child have a widespread infected skin condition?   Is your child taking any medicines for tuberculosis?   If the answer to any of these questions is YES, TELL YOUR DOCTOR.  Vaccination may need to be delayed or may not be recommended.     Warnings   Your child must not have another vaccination (injection) against infectious diseases in the same arm as the BCG vaccination for at least 3 months.  This is because it could produce inflammation in the local lymph glands.     How will you be given the vaccine?   The vaccine is mixed with the sterile water or sodium chloride solution. A small amount of the vaccine will be transferred to the skin of your child and the treated area will then be immediately punctured using a multiple puncture apparatus with 18-20 needles.   Your doctor will write down the name, dose and lot number of the vaccine, and the date it was given, in your child's medical records.  However, it may help you to remember what vaccines your child has received if you also make note of the name and dose of the vaccines, and the date on which they were given.     What side-effects might your child experience?   The injection-site may swell and become painful.  A blister or ulcer may develop and a dry dressing can be used if the ulcer oozes.  Be careful not to let tight clothing rub the ulcer.   Some people feel feverish, get a rash or have swollen glands after the vaccination.  Small babies occasionally get swollen glands in their arm-pits.   Very rarely, an abscess may form at the injectionsite or an allergic reaction may happen very soon after the injection.  This may cause collapse and breathing difficulties.   If you think the vaccination has upset your child in any way, TELL YOUR DOCTOR.     Use-by date and storage   The freeze-dried powder should be refrigerated between 2-8 C.  It should be protected from light.  The sterile water and sodium chloride solution for mixing with the vaccine should be stored below 25°C (at room temperature); it should not be frozen.  Once the powder and sterile water have been mixed, the mixture should be kept cool, protected from light and used within 4 hours.   The vaccine should not be used after the ""Use-by"" date on the label.     Further information   This leaflet does not contain the complete information about this vaccine.  If you have any questions or are unsure of anything, ask your doctor, who has access to additional information.

Your child is being treated with any medicine (such as warfarin) to prevent blood clots     Your child has glandular fever     Your child was born with a condition called ""phenylketonuria"".     If so, your doctor may decide to give your child a different medicine or change the dose of ‘Augmentin’.   IF YOU ARE TAKING ‘AUGMENTIN’, let your doctor know if you are pregnant (or think you could be) or if you are breast-feeding..    How to give   '  Augmentin  '   to your child      'Augmentin' 125/31 SF suspension is for children under six.  The usual dose is one spoonful (5 ml) of medicine three times a day for children between the ages of one and six years.  For children under one, the dose is worked out using the child's weight.  For example, if your child weighed 7.5 kg, they would need 2 ml of the medicine three times a day.  Your doctor will tell you how much medicine your child should take each day.  The doctor's instructions are also on the label of the bottle, so read it carefully.  If you have any questions about 'Augmentin', talk to your doctor or pharmacist.      For the best results, give your child 'Augmentin' just before meals.    Try to give this medicine as part of the daily routine – for example at meal times.        But remember, whenever you give your child the medicine, space the doses as evenly as possible through the day.      Try not to give your child more than one dose every four hours and never give two doses within one hour or so.    Keep giving your child the medicine until it is finished, even if he or she seems to be better.        Your child needs every dose to help fight off the infection.  If you stop giving your child this medicine before the end of the course, some bacteria may survive and cause the infection to come back.   It's now much easier to give medicines to children thanks to a new syringe designed for infants.  It will help you give your child the right dose. Or the chemist may give you a spoon.  If the chemist has given you a syringe, follow these simple rules.     Shake the bottle well before removing the cap.  Then put the rubber bung in the bottle.     Squeeze the syringe tip into the bung.  Use the syringe to measure out the right dose.     Put the syringe tip into your baby's mouth and drip the medicine in gently.  Don't hurry your child, allow time for him or her to swallow the medicine slowly.     After each dose, sterilise the syringe as you would do for the baby's bottle.  When you have finished, put the bottle and syringe somewhere safe, out of the reach of children     If your child is still unwell after taking all the medicine, go and see your doctor.    Never give more than the recommended dose each day.      What if I forget to give a dose?   If you forget to give a dose, don’t worry – just give it as soon as you remember.  But don’t give the next dose too soon.  Always try to keep the doses evenly spaced.  Try to wait about four hours before giving the next dose.  Do not give two doses within one hour or so.     What if my child has taken too much medicine?   If your child has taken too much ‘Augmentin’, contact your doctor or local hospital casualty department at once.  Show the doctor the sachets.    Information on possible side effects   The medicine can sometimes give your child an upset stomach or diarrhoea.  If this happens, the symptoms are usually mild and you may prevent them by giving your child each dose just before meals.   Some people get a rash when they take antibiotics.  If your child starts to itch or get a rash, stop giving 'Augmentin' and tell your doctor at once.  Other side effects include a swollen face and breathing problems.  But these are extremely rare.  Tell your doctor straight away if you notice these symptoms.   Some children may get to thrush (a yeast infection of the mouth, vagina, or skin folds) during treatment or soon after.  You can get treatment for thrush from your doctor or pharmacist.   Remind your doctor if your child is having blood tests, because ‘Augmentin’ sometimes causes short-term changes in blood-cell counts.   As with most infections, 'Augmentin' can sometimes cause rare and serious reactions.  See your doctor straight away if:     your child gets severe diarrhoea with bleeding;     you notice your child’s urine becoming darker or faeces (otherwise known as poo) becoming paler;   or      you notice your child’s skin or the whites of your child’s eyes turning yellow.     Some of these reactions can be delayed for several weeks after finishing the treatment.   If your child gets any other problems while taking this medicine tell your doctor or pharmacist.     Storing 'Augmentin'   Don't use this medicine if the expiry date printed on the pack has passed.   Store the medicine in a refrigerator (but do not freeze it).  Keep all medicines well out of the reach of children.   If your doctor asks you to stop giving this medicine, or if for any other reason there is some medicine left over, please return it to the pharmacist.   Remember, this medicine is just for   your   child.  Do not give it to anyone else.  It may not be suitable for them, even if their symptoms seem to be the same as your child’s.

"      Logynon   This booklet tells you about oral contraceptives in general and about Logynon in detail. Please read it carefully to get the best from Logynon. If you are in any doubt about these instructions contact your doctor, pharmacist or Family Planning clinic.    You and the pill How your body gets ready for pregnancy (the menstrual cycle)   You can usually become pregnant (conceive) from when you start to have periods, up until you are in your late 40s. Every menstrual cycle takes about 28 days. About halfway through this cycle an egg is released from one of your ovaries into a fallopian tube. This is called ovulation.   The egg travels down the fallopian tube towards your womb. When you make love, your partner's penis releases millions of sperm into your vagina. Some of these sperm travel up through your womb into your fallopian tubes. If there is an egg in one of these tubes, and a sperm reaches it, you can become pregnant. This is called 'conception'.   A fertilised egg gets embedded in the lining of your womb and takes 9 months to grow into a baby. As an egg can live for up to 2 days, and sperm for up to 5 days, you can become pregnant if you have made love up to 5 days before ovulation and for some time afterwards. If a sperm does not fertilise an egg, the egg is lost at the end of the menstrual cycle with the lining of your womb. This is called a 'period'.     How do natural hormones work?   Your menstrual cycle is controlled by two sex hormones made by your ovaries: one called oestrogen, the other progesterone (a progestogen). Oestrogen increases during the first half of your menstrual cycle, and makes your womb develop a thick lining, ready to receive the egg if conception happens. Progesterone comes later in the cycle and changes the lining of the womb still further to prepare it for pregnancy.   If you do not become pregnant, you make less of these hormones and this causes the lining of your womb to break down and the lining leaves your body as a period. But during pregnancy, your ovaries, and then the placenta (this attaches the growing baby to the womb and gives it food), carry on making progesterone and oestrogen to stop any more eggs being released.     How does the pill work?   A pill such as Logynon contains hormones which are like those your body produces (oestrogen and progestogen). These help stop you from getting pregnant, just as your natural hormones would stop you conceiving again when you are already pregnant.   The combined contraceptive pill protects you against getting pregnant in 3 ways:     No egg is released to be fertilised by sperm.     The fluid in the neck of your womb thickens so it is more difficult for sperm to enter it.     The lining of your womb does not thicken enough for an egg to grow in it.       How effective is the pill?   The pill is one of the most effective contraceptives apart from sterilisation. But this can only be true when it is taken correctly. So you must follow your doctor's instructions and take the tablets exactly as it says in the next section of this booklet.     Product information The name of your medicine is: Logynon     What does Logynon contain?

What you should know before taking Logynon   Before you start taking Logynon your pelvic organs, breasts and blood pressure should be checked by your doctor and these checks should be repeated regularly. The doctor will also make sure you are not pregnant.   If anyone in your family has had any illness caused by blood clots, or a heart attack, or a stroke at a young age, tell your doctor.   The following conditions need watching carefully while you are taking the pill:   If you have:     severe depressive states, past or present.     varicose veins.     diabetes (diabetes mellitus) or a tendency towards diabetes.     high blood pressure (hypertension).     fits (epilepsy).     the inherited form of deafness known as otosclerosis.     the disease of the nervous system called multiple sclerosis.     the inherited disease called porphyria.       calcium deficiency with cramps (tetany).     the movement disorder called Sydenham's chorea. - breast problems, past or present.     diseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardio vascular diseases).kidney diseases.     disturbed liver function.     you are very overweight (obese).     an intolerance of contact lenses.     systemic lupus erythematosus-SLE (inflammation of connective tissue).     asthma.     uterine fibroids (benign tumour of the womb).     gallstones.     migraine.     brown patches on the face and body (chloasma).

If any of these conditions gets worse or you have them for the first time, this may be a sign that you should stop taking Logynon.   When you stop taking Logynon it may take some time for your regular periods to return.     Taking other medicines with Logynon Some medicines may stop Logynon from working   Properly.   If you are taking any other medicine while you are taking Logynon, be sure to tell your doctor (or dentist). Your doctor (or dentist) can tell you whether you should use extra contraceptive precautions and for how long.   Medicines which can sometimes stop Logynon from working properly are antibiotics {such as ampicillin and rifampicin); griseofulvin (which is used to treat fungal infections); phenylbutazone (which is used as an anti-inflammatory drug to treat some types of joint diseases) phenytoin, primidone, phenobarbitone and some other medicines used in people with epilepsy, and carbamazepine (which can be used to treat epilepsy or other illnesses).   If you are taking any of these medicines you might still be able to use Logynon, but you will also need to use an extra contraceptive method Condoms or cap plus spermicide) while you are taking the other medicine and for 7 days after you stop taking it. If your present pack ends before these 7 days, start the next pack the next day without a break. This means taking a pill every day during your normal 7 pill-free days.   If you run two packs together you may not have a period until the end of two packs, but this is not harmful. If you do not have a period after the second pack, you must talk to your doctor before you start the next pack.   If you are taking rifampicin you will need to use another method of contraception as well as Logynon. You should do this while you are taking the rifampicin and for 4 weeks after you stop.   If you are diabetic your doctor may alter the dose of medicine required to treat your diabetes.   If you are in doubt check with your doctor, pharmacist or Family Planning clinic.    Stomach upsets   Being sick or having very bad diarrhoea may stop Logynon from working properly and make it less effective. Carry on taking Logynon as usual, and also use another method of contraception, {condom or cap plus spermicide) until 7 days after you have recovered from the stomach upset. If you finish your pack before these 7 days, start the next pack the next day without a break. This means taking a pill every day during your normal 7 pill-free days. If you run two packs together you may not have a period until the end of two packs, but this is not harmful. If you do not have a period after the second pack, you must talk to your doctor before starting the next pack. If your stomach upset continues for some time, consult your doctor who may consider another form of contraception.     Warnings   It has been suggested, on the basis of statistical evidence, that the risk of developing various disorders of the circulation of the blood is slightly greater in women who take the combined pill than in those who do not. This can lead to, for example, deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in the leg), strokes (blood clots and haemorrhages from the blood vessels of the brain), heart attacks or pulmonary embolism (blood clots blocking the arteries of the lungs). People do not always fully recover from these disorders, and, very rarely, they are fatal. Studies suggest that these disorders occur less often with modern low-dose oral contraceptives than with older pills.   Certain conditions increase the risk of thrombosis. They include:     smoking.     obesity.     some diseases of the heart and blood vessels.     diabetes.     migraine.     a major operation or period of immobilisation (e.g. you are in bed after an accident or operation or you have a plaster cast on a broken leg).     if any members of your family have suffered from thromboembolic diseases {e.g. deep vein thrombosis, stroke or heart attack) at a young age.     varicose veins.     If any of these conditions apply to you before you decide to take Logynon or while you are taking Logynon you must discuss them with your doctor.   The risk of arterial thrombosis (e.g. heart attack and stroke) associated with the pill increases with age and this risk is increased by cigarette smoking. For this reason, the use of combined pills by women in the older age-group, especially those who also smoke, is discouraged.   Signs and symptoms of blood clots are given in the section ""Reasons for stopping Logynon immediately"".   The pill does give a substantial degree of protection against cancers of the ovary and the lining of the womb. An increased risk of cervical cancer in long-term users of the pill has been reported in some studies. It is uncertain whether this increased risk is caused by the pill as it could be due to the effects of sexual behaviour and other factors.   The evidence linking use of the pill and breast cancer is unclear. Some studies suggest an increased risk of breast cancer in women below the age of 35, the risk increasing the longer the pill is used. Any possible increased risk of breast cancer with combined pills is, however, likely to be small.   On rare occasions, the use of the pill has led to liver diseases such as jaundice and benign liver tumours and, very rarely, it has been associated with some forms of malignant liver tumours (cancer) in long-term users. Liver tumours may lead to life-threatening intra-abdominal haemorrhage (bleeding in the abdomen). Therefore, if you have pain in the upper abdomen that does not soon clear up, tell your doctor. Also, if your skin becomes yellow ( jaundice) you must tell your doctor.   If you think you might be pregnant, stop taking Logynon and consult your doctor immediately. Use another method of contraception such as a condom until you see your doctor.   Certain conditions may sometimes get worse during use of the pill. The diseases are those listed under ""What you should know before taking Logynon"".     Reasons for stopping Logynon immediately   If you experience any of the following conditions, take no further tablets of Logynon and consult your doctor immediately. In the meantime use another method of contraception such as a condom.        While you are taking Logynon What to do if you miss a period   Occasionally, you may miss a period. While this can mean you are pregnant, it is most unlikely if you have taken your pills correctly. Take your next pack as normal. If you think that you might have put yourself at risk (e.g. missed pills, taking other medicines) or if you miss a second period, see your doctor at once.     What to do if you forget to take a pill   If you forget to take a pill please follow these instructions:    If you are more than 12 hours late in taking a pill, or have missed more than one pill   Contraceptive protection may be lower, so you must use extra protection. Follow the instructions for the 7-day rule.      7-day rule     take the most recent 'late' pill and continue to take your next pills at your normal times   and      use an extra contraceptive method (condoms or cap plus spermicide) for the next 7 days   and      if your present pack ends before the 7 days do, start the next pack the next day, without a break. Do not leave a gap between packs. You will not have a period until you have finished the next pack, but this is not harmful. You may see some bleeding on pill-taking days, but do not worry. If you do not have a period after the second pack, you must talk to your doctor before you start the next pack      If one pill is 12 hours late or less   Don't worry. Contraceptive protection should not be affected if you take the late pill at once, and keep taking your next pills at the usual time. This may mean taking two pills in one day.      What should you do if you lose a pill?   If you lose a pill, the easiest thing to do is take the last pill of the pack in place of the lost pill. Then take all the other pills on their proper days. Your cycle will be one day shorter than normal, but contraceptive protection is not affected. After your 7 pill-free days you will have a new starting-day, one day earlier than before. Should you lose a pack of pills halfway through, ask your doctor or pharmacist what to do.     What if you have bleeding between periods?   A small number of women may have a little breakthrough bleeding or spotting while taking Logynon, especially during the first few months. Normally, this bleeding is nothing to worry about, and will stop in a day or two. Keep taking the pills as usual and the problem should disappear after the first few packs.   If the bleeding keeps on returning, is annoying or long-lasting, talk to your doctor. Also, if you start to have breakthrough bleeding for the first time after being on Logynon for a long time, you should see your doctor.   Unexpected bleeding may also be a sign of irregular pill-taking, so try to take your pill at the same time every day.     Will you put on weight?   Unless you usually have trouble keeping your weight down this is unlikely. But you may find you have a bigger appetite while you are taking the pill, so it is wise to watch what you eat.      What if you want to have a baby?   The bleeding you have after each pack (including the last pack) is not a true period. Your doctor relies on the date of your last true period before you get pregnant to tell you when your baby will be born. So, if you stop taking Logynon to have a baby, use another method of contraception until you have had a true period. However, it will not be harmful if you become pregnant straight away.     Are there any extra benefits of the pill?   Your periods may become shorter, more regular and less painful. Heavy periods may become lighter. The symptoms that often make the last few days before a period so unpleasant (known as premenstrual syndrome) usually disappear. Long-term use of the pill reduces your risk of cancers of the ovaries and of the lining of the womb.     Overdosage   Overdosage may cause nausea, vomiting and, in females withdrawal bleeding. You should consult your doctor who will be able to advise you what action, if any, is necessary.     Possible side-effects   Sometimes unwanted effects occur with Logynon. These can be mild or serious.     Mild reactions   Sometimes mild unwanted effects can occur in the first few months after starting Logynon.     bleeding and spotting between your periods can sometimes occur for the first few months but this usually stops once your body has adjusted to Logynon. If it continues, becomes heavy or starts again, contact your doctor.     headaches.     feeling sick, being sick and stomach upsets.     sore breasts.     depressive moods, loss of interest in sex.     changes in weight.     chloasma (yellow brown patches on the skin). This may happen even if you have been using Logynon for a number of months. Chloasma may be reduced by avoiding too much sunlight.     poor tolerance of contact lenses.       Serious reactions   More serious reactions have sometimes been associated with contraceptive pills that contain oestrogen and progestogen, for example thrombosis (the formation of a clot in blood vessels) or liver disease. These are explained more fully in the ""Warnings"" section.    If you think that you have a serious adverse reaction to Logynon stop taking your tablets and consult your doctor as soon as possible  .   If you think you have an unwanted effect due to Logynon which is not included in this leaflet, tell your doctor or a pharmacist about it.   Effect on blood tests: The use of oral contraceptives may affect the results of certain laboratory tests. Always tell your doctor or the laboratory staff that you are using an oral contraceptive.

"    Intradermal BCG Vaccine BP (Dried Tub/Vac/BCG)   PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY before you (or your child) are vaccinated.  This leaflet provides a summary of the information available on the vaccine.  If you have any questions or are not sure about anything, ask your doctor.   The name of this product is INTRADERMAL BCG VACCINE, BP.  It is one of a group of medicines called vaccines, which are used to protect people against infectious diseases.    What is in the vaccine?   INTRADERMAL BCG Vaccine is a freeze-dried powder of a live, weakened strain of   Mycobacterium bovis   (the same type of bacteria that causes the infectious disease tuberculosis (TB), except that the weakened bacteria cannot cause the disease).  The powder is mixed with sterile water or sodium chloride solution before use.   When mixed with the sterile water or sodium chloride solution, each ml of the vaccine contains the equivalent of not less than 8 million units of the weakened strain of the bacteria.  The vaccine also contains dextran, glucose, Triton WR 1339 and water.   The vaccine is supplied as a freeze-dried powder in 10 dose containers (in packs of 10 or in packs of 5 with 5 containers of sterile water).  The vaccine is also supplied in 50 dose containers (in packs of 5 with 5 containers of sodium chloride solution).     How does the vaccine work?   When you are vaccinated with INTRADERMAL BCG Vaccine your body produces a response (called ""cell-mediated immunity"") against the weakened tuberculosis-causing bacteria.  If you later come into contact with TB, this same response will again be produced to protect you so that you do not catch the disease.     The Product Licence Holder and Manufacturer are:   Evans Medical Limited, Regent Park, Leatherhead, KT22 7PQ, England.     What is the vaccine used for?   INTRADERMAL BCG Vaccine is used to protect people against tuberculosis, a serious infectious disease which may affect any part of the body.  The disease most commonly affects the lungs (chest). The vaccine can be given to babies, children, adults and elderly.  Children are usually vaccinated while at school.     Before you receive your vaccination   Have you had a skin test to check that you are not already immune to tuberculosis? (Anyone over 3 months old should have the skin test before BCG vaccination).   Have you had Measles or German Measles recently? (This can affect the result of the skin test).   Do you think you may be allergic/sensitive to any of the ingredients in the vaccine which are listed above?   Do you feel feverish or do you have any type of infection?   Are you receiving any treatment that lowers your resistance to disease, for example, steroids, radiotherapy, or drugs used for treating cancer, or do you have a medical condition that affects your resistance to infection (for instance, cancer, leukaemia, HIV)?   Do you have a widespread infected skin condition?   Are you pregnant or breast-feeding?   Are you taking any medicines for tuberculosis?   Have you had any other vaccinations in the last 3 weeks?   If the answer to any of these questions is YES, TELL YOUR DOCTOR.  Vaccination may need to be delayed or may not be recommended.     Warnings   You must not have another vaccination (injection) against infectious diseases in the same arm as your BCG vaccination for at least 3 months.  This is because it could produce inflammation in the local lymph glands.     How will you be given the vaccine?   The vaccine will be made up and a dose withdrawn into a syringe.   For babies under three months of age your doctor will inject a single 0.05 ml dose of the vaccine into the skin. For children aged 3 months or over, adults and elderly the doctor will inject a single 0.1 ml dose of vaccine into the skin.   A small, white bleb will appear at the injection site. The injection site should be left uncovered.   Your doctor will write down the name, dose and lot number of the vaccine, and the date it was given, in your (or your child's) medical records.  However, it may help you to remember what vaccines you have received if you also make note of the name and dose of the vaccines, and the date on which they were given.     What side-effects might you (or your child) experience?   A small swelling appears within 2-6 weeks and this may develop into a blister or ulcer, about 10 mm in diameter. It heals in 6-12 weeks, and a dry dressing can be used if the ulcer oozes. Be careful not to let tight clothing rub the ulcer.   Some people feel feverish, get a rash or have swollen glands after the vaccination.  Small babies occasionally get swollen glands in their arm-pits.   Very rarely, an abscess may form at the injection site or an allergic reaction may happen very soon after the injection.  This may cause collapse and breathing difficulties.   If you (or your child) think the vaccination has upset you in any way, TELL YOUR DOCTOR.     Use-by date and storage   The freeze-dried powder should be refrigerated between 2-8 C. It should be protected from light.  The sterile water and sodium chloride solution for mixing with the vaccine should be stored below 25 C (at room temperature),it should not be frozen.  Once the powder and sterile water have been mixed, the mixture should be kept cool, protected from light and used within 4 hours.   The vaccine should not be used after the ""Use-by"" date on the label.     Further information   This leaflet does not contain the complete information about this vaccine.

Have you had an allergic reaction, skin rash or wheezing after taking aspirin or any other medicine used to treat painful conditions?

If you feel dizzy when you start to use Voltarol suppositories, do not drive or work machinery until these effects have worn off.     Whilst you are using Voltarol suppositories, your doctor may want to give you a check-up from time to time.      Voltarol suppositories 50mg and 100mg are not suitable for children.   Voltarol suppositories 25mg may be used in children aged 1 year or over.       Using your suppositories   It is important that you follow your doctor’s instructions about when to use your suppositories. Read the label on the box carefully: it will tell you when to use them. The usual dosages are:    Adults:   Voltarol suppositories are normally inserted once, twice or three times each day up to a maximum   total   daily dose of 150mg.     Children aged 1 year or over   Doses vary with age and your doctor will have prescribed Voltarol suppositories 25mg at a dose suitable for your child. Follow his/her instructions carefully.   If you are not sure about the dose, check with your doctor or pharmacist.      Inserting a suppository     If you need to empty your bowels, do so before inserting a suppository.

Push the suppository in as far as possible.     Lower your legs and, if possible, remain still for a few minutes.     If you feel your body wanting to expel the suppository, try to resist this. Lie still and press your buttocks together. It is important to keep the suppository in the rectum to allow it to melt and the medicine to be absorbed. Pushing the suppository high into the rectum with your finger will help to reduce this feeling.     Wash your hands.     If your doctor has prescribed Voltarol suppositories 25mg for your child, the procedure is very similar. After your child has emptied their bowels get them to lie on their front or side.

"      Patient Information Leaflet    Viraferon Injection     What is Viraferon?   Viraferon contains a substance known as alfa interferon. Alfa interferons are proteins which are normally produced by the body to help defend itself against viruses.     What type of medicine is it?   Viraferon is an alfa interferon used to treat some viral infections. It cannot be taken by mouth since it would be broken down by enzymes in the gut. It must therefore be administered by injection. The dose is measured in International Units (IU)     What do vials of Viraferon contain?   Viraferon is available as a solution. Solutions contain either 10 million IU or 25 million IU of interferon alfa-2b(rbe) per vial. They also contain the following inactive ingredients: glycine, sodium phosphate dibasic, sodium phosphate monobasic, methyl and propyl parabens, human albumin and water for injections.   Product Licence Holder: Schering-Plough Ltd, Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire AL? 1TW.   Manufactured by: Schering-Plough (Brinny) Co., Innishannon, County Cork, Ireland.     When is Viraferon used?   Viraferon is used to treat Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C/ Non-A, Non-B, which are viral infections of the liver.    What is Hepatitis?   Hepatitis simply means inflammation of the liver. It is often caused by infection with a virus. The four most important types of viral Hepatitis are known by the letters A, B, C and D.   Hepatitis A is the commonest type, and patients normally recover completely. Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C are a greater threat to health because they can develop into chronic disease (see below). Hepatitis D virus can only infect someone who has already contracted the Hepatitis B virus.     What is Hepatitis B?   The virus which causes Hepatitis B is carried by millions of people throughout the world. The virus is transferred from person to person by contact with body fluids such as blood, saliva and urine. It is most commonly spread by sexual contact or by sharing contaminated needles. The virus can also be transmitted from mother to child during (or soon after) birth.   The initial symptoms of Hepatitis B include fever, tiredness, loss of appetite and flu-like symptoms, followed by jaundice (the skin and the white of the eyes turn yellow). However, in some people the symptoms are very mild. The majority of people recover completely but a proportion will become chronic carriers. Hepatitis is considered to be chronic when the virus is still present in the body six months or more after the initial illness. This indicates that the body has not succeeded in overcoming the infection.   A minority of people with chronic Hepatitis B go on to develop cirrhosis (permanent scarring of the liver) or liver cancer, both of which can be fatal. Fortunately, effective treatment is now available for chronic Hepatitis B.     What is Hepatitis C?   Hepatitis C is caused by a different kind of virus to Hepatitis B, and it is more difficult to screen for in the blood. Hepatitis C is most often spread through blood transfusions, but it is also associated with drug abuse and sexual activity. Some patients will have initial symptoms similar to those in Hepatitis A or B, but these are generally less severe in Hepatitis C.   About half of the people infected with the Hepatitis C virus go on to develop the chronic disease (a higher incidence than that seen with Hepatitis B). There is  also a higher chance that these people will subsequently develop cirrhosis of the liver.   Your doctor will explain to you which of these conditions you have.      Are there any people who should not be treated with Viraferon?   You should not be treated if you:     are allergic to any of the ingredients in Viraferon     have a severe heart complaint     have severe kidney disease     have epilepsy, or other nervous system problems     have thyroid disease (unless you are taking treatment for it)     Children are not normally treated with Viraferon unless the doctor thinks that it is essential.   You should not take Viraferon if you have certain types of long-term liver disease e.g. cirrhosis (check with your doctor if you are not sure).     It may be necessary to carry out tests during treatment   At intervals whilst receiving Viraferon therapy and prior to starting treatment your blood will be tested. In addition, if you are being treated for Hepatitis B you may also need a special liver test (a liver biopsy).     Are there any other reasons why Viraferon should not be used?   If you are pregnant or breast-feeding a baby you should only be treated with Viraferon if you have discussed with your doctor whether the benefits of the medicine for you, the mother, outweigh any possible risks to the child. If you are of child-bearing age, you should use contraceptives during treatment.     What would happen if you were allergic to Viraferon?   Very rarely, some patients have allergic reactions following their first injection. This could be in the form of a severe, red or itchy rash, difficulty in breathing, or shock. Your doctor will then stop your treatment.     Should Viraferon be stopped for any other reason?   If you have any of the following illnesses before treatment, or develop them whilst on treatment, your doctor may need to reduce your dose of Viraferon, or you may need extra treatment to control them. Your doctor will decide by watching the signs and symptoms carefully, doing tests if necessary. In some cases it may be necessary to stop Viraferon altogether:     chest problems or pneumonia     diabetes     problems with blood clotting ,     liver conditions     low blood pressure     a heart attack or irregular heart beat     depression, confusion, unconsciousness     thyroid problems     psoriasis     If you notice any changes in your eyesight whilst you are taking Viraferon, you should tell your doctor as he may wish to perform an eye examination.     Are there any medicines which should not be given at the same time as Viraferon?   Sleeping tablets, medicines taken for anxiety (sedatives) and strong pain killers should not be taken during treatment unless you have checked with your doctor first. You can take 1-2 paracetamol 500 mg tablets 30 minutes before injection if you need to but remember not to exceed 8 tablets in any 24 hours.   Certain asthma drugs, called theophylline or aminophylline, may need a change in dosage during Viraferon treatment.     What is the dose?   The dose you are given depends on how big you are. It varies with your body surface area. Technically, this is measured in square metres (m2), but actually it is worked out from your weight and height.   There are also different doses according to the disease being treated. Sometimes doctors prescribe different doses to those shown below. If this applies   to you, you can discuss it with your doctor, if you have not already done so.     How is Viraferon given?   Usually by subcutaneous injection. This means Viraferon is injected with a short needle into the fatty tissue just under the skin. It is usually given three times a week on every other day, for example, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.    Disease treated   Dose   Hepatitis B:Usually 2.5 to 5 million lU/m2 3 times a week for 4 to 6 months by subcutaneous injection.   Chronic Hepatitis C/Usually 3 million IU 3 times a Non-A, Non-B:week for up to 18 months, by subcutaneous injection.     What to do in case of overdose   Contact your doctor as soon as possible.     Many patients give injections themselves at home   As Viraferon is usually given 3 times a week, it is usually more convenient to have injections at home. You can give subcutaneous injections yourself. These injections are simple to do and you will be shown how to do them. Sometimes a relative, friend or community nurse could do them for you.     Injecting yourself     Wash your hands thoroughly and wipe the rubber stopper on the vial with an alcohol swab supplied.     Taking a hypodermic syringe, remove the cap from the needle and push the needle through the rubber stopper on the vial.     Holding the vial upside down, slowly withdraw the correct volume of solution into the syringe, replace the cap on the needle and place the syringe on a clean flat surface whilst you prepare the area to be injected.       Choosing an injection site     The best sites are the thigh, the outer surface of the upper arm or the abdomen (not the navel or waistline). If you are thin, do not use the abdomen. You should use a different site for each injection.     Clean the injection site with an alcohol swab and let it dry. Remove the needle cap from the syringe, pinch a 2 inch fold of skin between your thumb and index finger and insert the needle into the skin fold at an angle of between 45° and 90°. Holding the syringe with one hand, pull back the plunger slightly and see if any blood is drawn up. If you see blood, do not inject; withdraw the needle and start again at a new site. If you do not see blood, slowly push the plunger to inject, withdraw the needle and gently hold an alcohol swab on the injection site. If it bleeds, apply an adhesive dressing. Replace the needle cap and safely discard the complete needle/syringe unit.       What to do if you forget to inject Viraferon   Inject your recommended dose as soon as you remember and then carry on as normal.    Are there any side-effects   Like all drugs, Viraferon has side effects. Although a lot of different side effects have been seen, you should  remember that most of them only rarely occur. Side effects are generally dose related and get better when treatment is stopped.   The most common side effects are ""flu-like"" symptoms, such as fever fatigue and headache. These symptoms are similar to those experienced when you catch flu and the body produces interferon naturally to fight off the virus. The feverish symptoms are most likely to occur 2 to 6 hours after the first few injections. After 2 weeks or so they are likely to disappear. Injecting Viraferon about 2 hours before bedtime and taking 1-2 paracetamol 500 mg tablets 30 minutes before the injection and again when you go to bed will help alleviate the symptoms. Remember not to ' take more than 8 tablets in any 24 hour period.   You may go on feeling tired after the first few weeks of Viraferon therapy. If this is the case, take plenty of rest and pace your activities. You may also suffer from nausea and lose your appetite.      pain and weakness, sleepiness, dizziness, dry mouth, hair loss, back pain, depression, increased sweating, taste alteration, irritability, difficulty sleeping, confusion, difficulty in concentrating and low blood pressure.     The following side-effects only occur rarely in a few patients being treated with Viraferon: abdominal pain, rash, nervousness, problems at the site of injection e.g. inflammation or redness, Herpes simplex, e.g. cold sores, itching, eye pain, anxiety, nose bleeds, coughing, sore throat, chest problems, pneumonia, inflammation of the lungs, drowsiness, loss of weight, swelling of the face, difficulty in breathing, indigestion, irregular heart beat, high blood pressure, increased appetite, decreased sex drive, bleeding of the gums, problems with your eyesight. Viraferon may also have an effect on the thyroid gland and cause high blood sugar. If you are having laboratory tests performed on your blood and urine, Viraferon may cause abnormal results. Very rarely, a few people have had fits after having high doses of Viraferon.   If you think you are suffering from these or any: other side effects, you should tell your doctor.     How you should store your Viraferon   Viraferon solution should be stored in a refrigerator at 2-8°C, but it can be stored at room temperature (below 25°C) for short periods e.g. when travelling long distances. Once you start using the vial, it should be kept in a refrigerator at 2-8°C. Do not continue using the solution after 28 days. You may wish to write the date when you first used the solution, on the vial.   Do not use Viraferon after the expiry date which is stamped on the label.     If there is anything you do not understand   You will see from this leaflet that Viraferon is quite a complex medicine. If there is anything you do not understand, ask your doctor to explain it.

Do not give BONEFOS TABLETS to children.   Your doctor will perform regular tests to monitor your medical condition.    How to Take Your Medicine   The usual recommended dose is as follows:     2 x 800mg tablets a day taken as a single dose   or      in two divided doses of 1 x 800mg tablet per dose.     However your doctor may prescribe up to 4 x 800mg tablets a day.   Do not take more than the doctor has prescribed.   In the event of an overdosage consult a doctor immediately.   Swallow the tablets whole with a little liquid, but   NOT   with milk.  Take the tablets at least 1 hour before or 1 hour after food.  The best time to take a single daily dose of Bonefos is last thing at night before you go to bed.   If BONEFOS TABLETS are taken with milk or with food, it is more difficult for them to enter your blood stream and so you will not get the full benefit of your medicine.

NORPROLAC is used to treat patients with conditions which result from having high levels of prolactin in the blood. Prolactin is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland. High levels may cause excess milk production, changes in menstrual bleeding patterns, infertility and reduced sexual drive.      Before taking your medicine   Tell your doctor before you start using NORPROLAC tablets if the answer to any of the following questions is yes:     Do you suspect that you have had an allergic reaction to, or have been upset by any of the ingredients in NORPROLAC (listed in ‘What’s in your medicine’)?     Do you have liver or kidney problems?     Do you suffer or have you ever suffered from any psychiatric conditions?     Are you planning to become pregnant? NORPROLAC may increase fertility. Women of child-bearing age who do not wish to become pregnant should use a reliable method of contraception.     Are you pregnant? Information on the use or NORPROLAC in pregnancy is limited. It is recommended that NORPROLAC is stopped when pregnancy is confirmed, however, some pacients may need NORPROLAC therapy during pregnancy. If you become pregnant whilst taking NORPROLAC you should tell your doctor as soon as possible.     Are you breast-feeding? It is not known whether the active ingredient in NORPROLAC passes into breast milk. NORPROLAC reduces production of breast-milk and patients should not try to breast-feed whilst taking this medicine.     Are you taking any other medicines (either bought or prescribed)? Some medicines used for psychiatric conditions may reduce the effect of NORPROLAC       Effect of alcohol:-         Effects on driving or operating machinery :-   Since NORPROLAC may cause reduced blood pressure, particularly during the first few days of treatment or following dosage increases, this may result in reduced alertness or fainting. Patients should therefore be cautious when driving a vehicle or operating machinery.     Taking your medicine   Follow the instructions given to you by your doctor. The label on your medicine should tell you how much medicine to take and when to take it. If it does not, or you are not sure, ask your doctor or pharmacist.   If your doctor has given you a ""starter pack"", the dose is 25 micrograms (one pink tablet) daily for the first 3 days, followed by 50 micrograms daily (one blue tablet) for the next 3 days. From day 7, the recommended dose is 75 micrograms daily, which may then be increased by your doctor. Some patients may need 300 micrograms daily or higher. You should not change the dose yourself.   NORPROLAC tablets should be taken once a day at bedtime with some food.     remove the tablet from the foil (as shown in picture)      place the tablet in your mouth     take a mouthful ot water and then swallow the tablet       Missed dose   If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If you do not remember until it is almost time for your next dose, take your next dose as usual and carry on as before. Do not double the dose to make up for the one you missed.     Overdose   If you accidentally take too much of your medicine tell your doctor immediately or go to your nearest Casualty Department.      After taking your medicine   Side-effects are most common during the first few days of treatment and tend to disappear when treatment is continued.   The most common side-effects are feelings of sickness, headache, dizziness and tiredness.   Less common side-effects include loss of appetite, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhoea, difficulty in sleeping, increased water retention, flushing and nasal congestion.   NORPROLAC may cause your blood pressure to fall when you stand up, which may result in fainting, particularly in the first few days of therapy or following an increase in your dosage. Therefore, the doctor will check on your blood pressure at these times.   A small number of patients taking NORPROLAC have experienced a change in mental status, which reverses when treatment is stopped,   Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you suffer from any of these side effects or from any other side-effects not mentioned in this leaflet.

"    DORALESE TILTAB tablets    PATIENT INFORMATION LEAFLET ON 'DORALESE TILTAB' TABLETS   Please read this leaflet before you take your medicine.  You must follow your doctor's advice.  If there is anything you do not understand, please ask your doctor or pharmacist (chemist).    Keep this leaflet until you have finished all your prescribed course of 'Doralese'.  You may want to read it again.    If you are helping someone else to take this medicine, please read this leaflet before you give the first dose.     YOUR MEDICINE IS 'DORALESE'    What is 'Doralese'?    'Doralese' is the maker's name for this medicine for treating an enlarged prostate gland (benign prostatic hypertrophy).  Each 'Doralese' Tablet contains 20 milligrams of indoramin, the ingredient that treats the condition.    What is the prostate?    The prostate is a gland at the bottom of the bladder.  It surrounds the tube (the urethra) that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body.  If the prostate becomes bigger, it may ""squeeze"" the urethra making it difficult for you to pass urine.  This means that the flow of urine may be weaker or that you may have to pass water much more often than before.  This can happen during the day and also at night so you may have to get up several times every night to pass water.  It can also mean that you may have to wait for the urine flow to start, or that it may be difficult for you to stop completely.   As men get older, their prostate grows in size and some men will suffer these symptoms.  Some will need a simple operation to relieve these symptoms; others will not need any treatment.    What does 'Doralese' do?    As the prostate gland gets bigger, it presses on the urethra making it more difficult to pass urine.  'Doralese' relaxes the muscles in the prostate, helping to improve urine flow.  It can be used for patients who do not need or want an operation, and also for patients waiting for an operation.     IMPORTANT THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT 'DORALESE'      Take 'Doralese' as directed by your doctor. Read the dispensing label.       It is important to take 'Doralese' for as long as your doctor has told you.       Like all medicines, 'Doralese' sometimes causes unwanted effects. (You will find more about this later in this leaflet).       'Doralese' may cause drowsiness.  If you are affected, do not drive or operate machinery.  Do not take alcoholic drinks.       ALWAYS KEEP MEDICINES OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN.      For more information on 'Doralese', please read the rest of this leaflet.     BEFORE TAKING YOUR MEDICINE    What should I do if I think I have any of the following conditions?   Heart failure Serious kidney or liver problems Parkinson's disease Epilepsy or fits Depression High blood pressure Do not take 'Doralese' without first checking with your doctor.  You may need to be given a lower dose or another medicine.    If I am taking any other medicines, will 'Doralese' affect them?    You must not take the antidepressants called MAOls (mono-amine oxidase inhibitors) at the same time as taking 'Doralese' so check with your doctor before you start.  If you are taking antihypertensives (for high blood pressure) make sure that your doctor knows about this.  Some tablets (e.g. pain killers, other antidepressants, nerve tablets and antihistamines) which may make you drowsy, can sometimes have a stronger effect if taken with 'Doralese'.      TAKING YOUR MEDICINE   'Doralese' Tablets should be swallowed with water.    How much should I take and how often?    Do as your doctor tells you and read the dispensing label carefully; it will tell you how many 'Doralese' Tablets to take for each dose.   DO NOT TAKE MORE THAN THE DOSE YOUR DOCTOR HAS RECOMMENDED.  Ask your pharmacist or doctor if you are not sure.    How long should I carry on taking 'Doralese'?    As long as your doctor tells you.  If you stop treatment, your symptoms may come back.    What should I do if I forget to take a dose?    If you forget to take a dose at the right time, take it as soon as you remember, but if you miss a dose completely do not take twice as much the next time.  Just carry on as normal.     AFTER TAKING YOUR MEDICINE    What unwanted effects might it have?    You may feel drowsy when you start taking 'Doralese'.  This is generally not too troublesome and the symptoms usually clear up after a few days.  If you feel drowsy you should not drive, work machinery or do other things which require you to be alert.  If you do feel drowsy, you must not take alcohol or any other medicine which also makes you feel drowsy.   A few people may suffer dizziness, dry mouth, stuffy nose, weight gain or depression while on 'Doralese'.  These symptoms are usually mild.  But, if you suffer badly, or develop any unusual problems while you are taking this medicine, tell your doctor.    What if I have taken too much?    If you have taken a large amount, tell your doctor or go to Casualty at the nearest hospital at once.     STORING YOUR MEDICINE    How should I store 'Doralese' Tablets?

"      Suprecur Nasal Spray    Please read this carefully before you start to take your medicine. This leaflet only provides a summary of the information available on your medicine. If you have any questions, or are not sure about anything, ask your doctor or pharmacist.     What is Suprecur?   Suprecur contains buserelin (as buserelin acetate, 150 micrograms in each spray). It also contains citric acid sodium chloride, sodium citrate benzalkonium chloride and water. It is a nasal spray; one bottle contains 84 spray doses (2 weeks treatment for endometriosis) .   Buserelin is one of a class of medicines called LHRH analogues. It works by decreasing the production of sex hormones.   The product licence for Suprecur is held by Hoechst UK Ltd, Hoechst House, Salisbury Road, Hounslow Middlesex, TW4 6JH.   Suprecur is made by Hoechst AG, D-65926 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.     Why use Suprecur   Suprecur is used to treat endometriosis and also as part of a treatment for infertility.     Before taking your medicine   Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or breast feeding.   Tell your doctor if you are diabetic, have high blood pressure or have ever suffered from depression.   Tell your doctor if you are taking any other medicines.   If you are being treated for endometriosis, tell your doctor if you are using oral contraceptives (the pill). You should change to another (barrier) form of contraceptive during treatment with Suprecur. Tell your doctor of any problems you have had with this or other medicines in the past.   If you feel drowsy after taking this medicine, do not drive or operate machinery.     How should I use Suprecur?   Follow your doctor's advice about when and how to use your medicine and look at the label and leaflet. Your pharmacist may also help if you are not sure. You should start treatment on the first or second day of your period.   The usual dose for the treatment of endometriosis is two sprays (one into each nostril) three times a day. This is best taken in the morning, at mid-day and in the evening. For use as part of infertility the usual dose is one spray (in one nostril only) four times a day. Some clinics use higher doses.   It is very important to use Suprecur at regular intervals throughout the waking hours.   You can continue to use Suprecur if you have a cold. Blow your nose well before using the spray. If you are using a nasal decongestant do not use the decongestant for at least 30 minutes after you have used Suprecur.   If you miss a dose of Suprecur, take another as soon as you remember unless it is nearly time for your next dose. Never double-up on the next dose to make up for the one you missed.   If you take too much Suprecur tell your doctor as soon as possible.     What undesirable effects may Suprecur cause?   Any medicine can have side-effects.    You will probably have a period during the first few weeks of treatment. After this your periods will probably stop, although some people may bleed again.   You may notice symptoms such as hot flushes, sweating or you may have a dry vagina, decreased interest in sex or find intercourse painful.   Cysts (swellings) can sometimes occur in the ovaries with buserelin but do not interfere with treatment.   During long term treatment the amount of calcium in bone may decrease. Most of the calcium is regained when treatment is stopped.   Some people find that the nasal spray irritates the nose and may even cause nosebleeds or make you feel hoarse. If you have any problems tell your doctor. Most people do not have any other side effects to Suprecur. However, if you notice any of the following, tell your doctor and ask if you should continue using the nasal spray:     headaches, palpitations, feeling tired, nervous, drowsy, depressed, anxious or emotional: have disturbed sleep or lapses in memory or concentration.     have a problem with hearing or seeing or have a feeling of pressure behind the eyes.     stomach pain or upsets (e.g. feel or be sick, constipation, diarrhoea), feel thirsty or notice any changes in weight or appetite.     breast tenderness, or changes in the size of the breast, splitting nails, spots, dry skin or vaginal discharge.     back or limb pains, or joint discomfort.     shortness of breath, reddening of the skin, itchy rash or asthma.     increase or decrease in scalp or body hair.     If you feel unwell after using the spray, or notice anything unusual or unexpected, tell your doctor.     How should I store Suprecur?   Store your nasal spray below 256C. Do not freeze it. Do not use it past the expiry date on the bottle.   One bottle has enough solution to last two weeks if you are being treated for endometriosis at the usual dose. You should stop using a bottle at the end of two weeks and start a new bottle. If you are using Suprecur as part of an infertility treatment the one bottle can be used for up to five weeks after first opening.    Keep the spray in a safe place where children cannot reach it.   Your medicine could harm them.   If your doctor decides to stop the treatment, return any leftover spray to your pharmacist so that it can be disposed of safely. Only keep it if your doctor tells you to.    Remember   this medicine is for   you  . Only a doctor can prescribe it for you. Never give it to other people. It may harm them, even if they have the same symptoms as you.   This leaflet does not contain all the information about your medicine. If you have any questions or are not sure about anything, ask your doctor or pharmacist, who have access to additional information.   This leaflet only applies to Suprecur Nasal Spray. Last revision February 1996.       How to use the spray bottle     Remove screw cap from bottle.     Remove metered-dose nebulizer from transparent plastic container and take off both protective caps .     Screw nebulizer on to bottle.     Before first application only, pump 5-8 times holding bottle vertical, until the solution has filled the system and a uniform spray is emitted. The prelimi-   nary pumping is for the purpose of filling the system and testing the spray. It must not be repeated after the first use, in order to avoid wasting the contents.     Keeping bottle vertical and bending head over it slightly, spray solution into nose. If necessary, the nose should be cleaned before applying the solution.     After use leave nebulizer on bottle. After replacing protective cap, spray bottle is best stored in its transparent container in an upright position.        ",
"    What you should know about Distamine   Please read this leaflet carefully before you start to take your medicine.  It does not contain all the information about your medicine that you may need to know.  Please ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.  This leaflet only applies to Distamine.    What is in your medicine?   Your medicine is called Distamine, a brand of penicillamine.  The active ingredient is D-penicillamine base.   The tablets come in two strengths (different sized tablets) containing 125mg and 250mg of the active ingredient, in bottles of 100 tablets.  They all have a white coating.  The 125mg tablets are 8mm across and are marked DS on one side and 125 on the other.  The 250mg tablets are 10mm across and are marked DM on one side and 250 on the other.   All the tablets contain the inactive ingredients microcrystalline cellulose, polyvidone, sodium starch glycolate and stearic acid.  The coating contains glycerol, E171 and methyl hydroxypropyl cellulose.      Distamine is a chelating agent.  This means that it binds to certain metals, including lead and copper, to help remove them from your body if necessary.  Distamine also helps to relieve the pain and stiffness of rheumatoid arthritis if other medicines and rest have not worked.   Distamine is made by Eli Lilly and Company Limited, Kingsclere Road, Basingstoke, Hampshire, RG21 6XA. The product licence is held by Dista Products Limited, Dextra Court, Chapel Hill, Basingstoke, Hampshire, RG21 5SY.     Why Distamine?   Distamine is used to treat serious, active rheumatoid arthritis, including Still’s disease in children.  It also treats Wilson’s disease, a condition where the body cannot get rid of copper properly; a kidney problem called cystinuria; lead poisoning; and chronic active hepatitis, a liver disease.    Before taking your medicine   Make sure it is safe for you to take Distamine,     If you answer YES to any of the following questions, or you are not sure, tell your doctor or pharmacist.      Have you ever had a rash or other allergic reaction to Distamine? (An allergic reaction may be a rash, itching, swelling or breathing difficulties.)     Have you ever had agranulocytosis (fever, mouth ulcers and severe weakness) after taking penicillamine?     Have you ever had thrombocytopenia (bruising and continual bleeding) after taking penicillamine?     Have you had lupus erythematosus (LE)?     Are you pregnant or could you be?     Are you taking any other medicine, especially for arthritis, including aspirin or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicine (NSAID)?     Have you got kidney problems?     Your doctor will ask you to have a blood test and have your kidneys checked before you start taking Distamine.  He or she will test your blood and urine regularly while you are taking the medicine.  This is so that your doctor can adjust your dose and look out for any side-effects.     If you are taking iron tablets, take them at least 2 hours after you have taken the Distamine.      Distamine is not a painkiller so you should not expect to feel better straight away.  But after a few weeks you will feel better and your joints will be less stiff and painful.      Distamine can help to treat rheumatoid arthritis but not other kinds of arthritis.        Please read the back of this leaflet          What you should know about Distamine - continued Taking your medicine     Follow your doctor s instructions carefully.  Check the label for how many tablets to take and how often to take them.  Never take more tablets than your doctor tells you to.      Usual doses    Adults    Rheumatoid arthritis:   take 125 to 250mg a day for the first month.  Your doctor will then tell you how to increase the dose gradually over several months until you are feeling better.  He or she may then change your dose to keep you well.  This new dose is usually 500 to 750mg a day, but it can be as high as 1 500mg.   It may be several months before you feel better.  But if there is no improvement you should stop taking the tablets after a year.   If you stay well for 6 months your doctor may reduce the dose.   If you are elderly, you may be given a smaller dose.  Do not take more than 1000mg a day    Wilson’s disease:   take 1500 to 2000mg a day spread over 3 or 4 doses.  Once you are better, your doctor may reduce your dose.   It is best not to take 2000mg a day for more than a year.   If you are elderly, your dose will depend on your weight The usual dose is 20mg a day for each kilogram of bodyweight.    Cystinuria:   If you have cystine stones your dose will be 1000 to 3000mg a day.  If you are taking the tablets to prevent stones, you will take 500 to 1500mg at bedtime.   If you are elderly, your dose may be smaller.    Lead poisoning:   take 1000 to 1 500mg a day in 3 or 4 doses until your doctor tells you that the amount of lead in your urine is normal.   If you are elderly, your dose will depend on your weight.  The usual dose is 20mg a day for each kilogram of bodyweight.    Chronic active hepatitis:   Start with 500mg a day.  Your doctor will gradually increase the dose over 3 months, to 1250mg a day.     Children     The dose depends on the weight of the child.

"      Prempak-C Conjugated oestrogens & norgestrel   Please read this leaflet carefully before you start to take your tablets. The leaflet contains some information about Prempak-C, which has been prescribed for you by your doctor. If you have any questions or are unsure about anything, ask your doctor or pharmacist.    What is in my tablets?   The name of your medicine is Prempak-C. It contains two types of tablets: the set of 28 maroon or yellow tablets each contain a mixture of natural hormones called conjugated oestrogens, and the set of 12 light brown tablets each contain 0.15 mg of norgestrel, which acts in the same way as the hormone progesterone produced by your own body.   The colour of the 28 oestrogen tablets will depend upon which dose of oestrogen your doctor has prescribed for you: maroon tablets contain 0.625 mg conjugated oestrogens, and yellow tablets contain 1.25 mg of conjugated oestrogens.   Prempak-C also contains inactive ingredients. The oestrogen tablets contain lactose, methylcellulose, magnesium stearate, sucrose, glyceryl mono-oleate, polyethylene glycol, carnauba wax, calcium sulphate anhydrous, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sodium benzoate, microcrystalline cellulose, pharmaceutical glaze (shellac) and titanium dioxide (E171).   The norgestrel tablets contain: lactose, starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone, talc, magnesium stearate, sucrose, polyethylene glycol, calcium carbonate, bleached wax, carnauba wax, titanium dioxide(E171).   Dyes are used to colour the tablets:   maroon oestrogen tablets: E110, E132, E127.   yellow oestrogen tablets: E104, E110.   light brown norgestrel tablets: E 172.   Prempak-C is presented in a carton containing three calendar packs. Each calendar pack contains 28 days' treatment: 28 oestrogen tablets with 12 norgestrel tablets to take with the last 12 oestrogen tablets in each pack. The calendar pack has days 1 to 28 printed on it to help you keep track of your tablets.   Prempak-C is one of a group of medicines called Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT), and is used to treat some of the symptoms of the menopause or ""change of life"".    Product licence holder:   John Wyeth & Brother Limited trading as Wyeth Laboratories, Taplow, Maidenhead, Berkshire SL6 0PH.    Manufacturer:   Wyeth Medica Ireland, Little Connell, Newbridge, Co. Kildare, Republic of Ireland.     What are my tablets used for?   During the menopause, the level of the oestrogen in your body will decrease. Oestrogen is one of the main hormones responsible for maintaining your normal periods. As the amount of oestrogen produced by your body decreases, your periods may become irregular and may only occur once every few months. Eventually your periods will stop altogether.   Oestrogen is also responsible for helping to keep many parts of the body healthy, such as the skin, bones, urinary system and the lining of the vagina. The lack of oestrogen which causes the menopause is also responsible for many of the symptoms you have at this time, such as hot flushes, night sweats and vaginal dryness. By replacing the oestrogen that your body no longer produces Prempak-C can relieve some of these symptoms. It can also help to prevent bone thinning (osteoporosis).   Women who still have their womb (uterus) should not take oestrogen tablets alone for HRT. The reason for this is that the oestrogen can make the lining of the womb grow too much and cause irregular bleeding. Your Prempak-C contains norgestrel which protects the lining of the womb and prevents too much  growth. It is very important that you take a norgestrel tablet each day from day 17 to day 28 as shown on the pack. (please see the section ""What should I know before taking my tablets?"")     Are there reasons for not taking HRT?   You should not take Prempak-C if:     You know or suspect you are pregnant, or you are breast feeding.     You have or have had breast cancer.     You are suffering from a disorder which causes clotting in the blood vessels.     You have any unusual vaginal bleeding which has not been diagnosed.     You have serious liver disease.     You have serious heart disease or kidney disease.     You are allergic to any of the ingredients of Prempak C (see page 2).     You have, or your doctor suspects you might have, a cancer which is made worse by oestrogens.       What should I know before taking my tablets?   Some studies with HRT have shown a small increased risk of breast cancer when HRT has been used over a long period of time. Other studies, however, have not shown this link. Whilst taking HRT you should regularly check your breasts and tell your doctor if you find any lumps.   If you have had breast lumps in the past, your doctor will regularly check your breasts for any changes.   There is an increased risk of cancer of the lining of the womb (endometrium) if you take oestrogen-only HRT. However, taking tablets of a progestogen such as norgestrel for twelve days each month reduces this additional risk. Prempak-C contains norgestrel tablets for this reason.   If you have suffered from blood clots in your legs or lungs, a stroke or heart attack, your doctor will monitor you closely.   It is unlikely that HRT will affect your blood pressure. Your doctor will monitor your blood pressure at your regular check ups, especially if you are already being treated for high blood pressure.   You will probably have a regular monthly bleed at the end of each month. This is often at about the time you are taking the last few norgestrel tablets. This is quite normal and helps to keep the lining of the womb healthy. It does not mean that your periods have started again or that you could become pregnant.   It is possible that these monthly bleeds will eventually stop whilst taking Prempak-C. This is also normal: however you should tell your doctor if your bleeding pattern changes, or if any unusual bleeding occurs once you have become settled on Prempak-C.     Special warnings   Certain diseases may be made worse by HRT. If you have any of the following conditions your doctor will monitor you closely: otosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosis, porphyria, melanoma, diabetes, depression asthma, migraine, epilepsy, fibroids or endometriosis. Tell your doctor if you notice any change in your condition whilst taking Prempak-C.   The risk of gall bladder disease is slightly increased in women taking HRT.   HRT may affect some medical tests. If you visit a hospital or clinic for any medical tests you should tell the doctor concerned that you are taking HRT.     Is Prempak-C like the contraceptive Pill?   No. The contraceptive Pill uses higher doses of synthetic (man-made) hormones to prevent ovulation and fertilisation of eggs. Prempak-C is NOT a contraceptive. It is important that you use a reliable form of non-hormonal contraception (such as a condom) if there is any possibility that you may still become pregnant. You should discuss this with your doctor.       Will Prempak-C affect my driving?   There is no evidence to suggest that taking Prempak-C will affect your ability to drive or to operate machinery.     How do I take my tablets?   Start your pack with the tablet marked ""Day 1"". You will see that the days of the week have been printed on the top of your pack. Make a hole through the day of the week on which you take your first pill. Pills 8,15 and 22 will also be taken on this day of the week, so if you are not sure if you have taken your pill(s) you can count backwards, as a reminder.   The usual dose is one oestrogen tablet every day until Day 16. You should then take one oestrogen tablet every day plus one norgestrel tablet every day from days 17-28 as marked on the pack. Swallow the tablet(s) with a drink of water. Take your tablet(s) at about the same time each day.   Do not leave a break between packs unless your doctor tells you to. Do not stop taking Prempak-C without first discussing it with your doctor.     How long do I need to take Prempak-C for?   That really depends on why you and your doctor have decided on a course of treatment. If you are taking HRT to relieve your immediate menopausal symptoms, such as hot flushes and night sweats, you may be prescribed HRT for between three to twelve months or longer. If, however, you or your doctor are worried about osteoporosis (bone thinning) and you wish to protect yourself now for the future, you may be prescribed HRT for between five to ten years or even longer.     What if I miss a tablet or tablets?   If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember, then go on as before. If more than one or two doses have been missed, consult your doctor.   If you do forget to take your tablets, you may have some slight bleeding or spotting.     What if I take too many tablets?   Do not worry. It is unlikely that serious problems will occur. You may feel some nausea (sickness), or experience a short period of vaginal bleeding if you take too many tablets. If in any doubt, consult your doctor or pharmacist.     Can I wash off the coating or crush the tablets?   It is best not to try to take off the coating or crush the tablets, as this could affect the way Prempak-C works.

"      WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT LESCOL (fluvastatin) CAPSULES   Please read this carefully before you start to take your medicine, even if you have already been taking   LESCOL   for some time. If you have any questions or are not sure about anything, ask your doctor or pharmacist (chemist).    WHAT’S IN YOUR MEDICINE   The active ingredient contained in   LESCOL   capsules is fluvastatin sodium.   Capsules are available in two strengths providing either 20 mg or 40 mg fluvastatin free acid.   Both capsule strengths contain the following inactive ingredients: magnesium stearate; sodium hydrogen carbonate; talc; cellulose microcrystalline; maize starch; calcium carbonate; gelatine; E171; E172.   The small half-brown, half-yellow capsules printed with the Sandoz logo in white and XU 20 mg in red contain 20 mg of fluvastatin. The larger half-brown, half-orange capsules printed with the Sandoz logo in white and XU 40 mg in red contain 40 mg of fluvastatin.   Both the 20 mg and 40 mg capsules are contained in calendar packs of 28 capsules. The 40 mg capsules are also available in calendar packs of 56 capsules for 40 mg twice daily dosing.    LESCOL   is one of a group of drugs known as cholesterol lowering agents. (See ""Why does your doctor want you to use   LESCOL   capsules? "").    Product Licence holders:SANDOZ PHARMACEUTICALS Manufactured by:SANDOZ AG        WHY DOES YOUR DOCTOR WANT YOU   From the results of your blood tests, your doctor has found that despite your low fat diet you still have too much of one type of fat called cholesterol in your blood. Although cholesterol is vital to the health of your body, too much of it in the blood has been found to be one of the important causes of heart disease.   Your doctor has therefore prescribed   LESCOL   together with your diet to help lower cholesterol levels and so reduce your risk of heart problems.   LESCOL   is one of a group of cholesterol lowering drugs and exerts its main effect in the liver where cholesterol is made.     BEFORE TAKING YOUR MEDICINE   Tell your doctor before you start taking   LESCOL   if the answer to any of the following questions is yes:     Have you ever had an allergic reaction to similar products, or any of the ingredients in   LESCOL   capsules (listed in ""What’s in your medicine"")?     Do you have any liver problems, or have you had a disease which may have affected your liver? Your doctor will usually carry out liver function tests before you start therapy and periodically thereafter, as slight increases in liver enzymes have occurred in a small number of patients on   LESCOL   therapy.     Do you have a history of heavy alcohol consumption?     Do you have any kidney problems?     Are you pregnant, or planning to become pregnant? If you do become pregnant whilst taking   LESCOL   tell your doctor.     Are you breast feeding?     Has this medicine been prescribed for someone less than 18 years of age?     Are you taking any other medications?     Are you taking any other medications?   Some medicines can interfere with your treatment, so make sure to check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking any other medications whether bought or prescribed. In particular tell your doctor if you are taking any immunosuppressive drugs (e.g cyclosporin), gemfibrozil, nicotinic acid, erythromycin or rifampicin.       TAKING YOUR MEDICATION   Your doctor will have chosen the right dose of   LESCOL   for you. Normally the doctor will start you off on 20 mg of   LESCOL   per day, taken in the evening. After that the doctor will periodically check your cholesterol levels and may adjust your dose, up to a maximum of 40 mg twice a day, depending on what the levels are. If this is the case you should take one capsule in the morning and one in the evening. The usual dose however is 20 to 40 mg of   LESCOL   once daily. Follow your doctors instructions exactly and never change the dose yourself.   In addition to   LESCOL  , your doctor may also prescribe you a resin type drug like cholestyramine which also helps to lower your cholesterol. As this type of drug can interfere with the way   LESCOL   is taken up in the body, you should take   LESCOL   at least four hours after the resin.   Remember to continue with your low fat diet while you are taking   LESCOL  . Ask your doctor or pharmacist it you are unsure about how much medicine to take or when to take it.      AFTER TAKING YOUR MEDICINE   Most people benefit from taking this medicine, but a few can be upset by it. Side-effects are usually mild and tend to disappear when treatment is continued. If you experience any of the following, or any other unusual effects, tell your doctor at the earliest opportunity:     Indigestion     Nausea     Difficulty in sleeping     Abdominal pain     Headache Headache     If you have muscle weakness, tenderness or pain and particularly if, at the same time, you feel unwell or have a high temperature, stop taking   LESCOL   and tell your doctor immediately.   In a small number of patients slight increases in liver enzymes have occurred and most patients did not develop any symptoms. In these patients the enzyme levels returned to normal or became more normal when therapy was stopped. Your doctor will usually carry out liver function tests before you start therapy and periodically thereafter.       Remove the capsule from the foil as shown in the picture. Both the 20 mg and 40 mg   LESCOL   capsules are contained in calendar packs of 28 capsules with the days of the week marked on the foil strips.      STORING YOUR MEDICINE   Do not use this product after the expiry date printed on the carton.   Leave your capsules in the foil, and only remove them when it is time for you to take your medicine.     If your doctor has prescribed   LESCOL   40 mg twice a day for you, then you should receive a calendar pack containing 56 capsules. These packs contain folders of capsules which clearly separate the morning and evening doses.   Place the capsule in your mouth, and swallow whole with a glass of water.     MISSED DOSE   If you forget to take a dose, take one as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for you to take your next dose. Then go on as before.     OVERDOSE   If you accidentally take too much of your medicine, tell your doctor immediately or go to your nearest Casualty Department.    Store your capsules below 25°C.

Many different diseases may be improved by the careful use of strong medicines like this, which mainly work by reducing inflammation in the body.   If you are not sure why you are on these tablets, ask your doctor.      Before you take your tablets      Have you been told you are allergic to Prednesol Tablets or any of the ingredients?     Have you had tuberculosis (TB), diabetes, epilepsy, depression, glaucoma (raised eye pressure), hypertension (high blood pressure), osteoporosis (thinning of the bones) or stomach ulcers?     Do you have liver or heart disease? - Have you just been immunised?     Do you have a viral infection eg chicken pox, or other infection - Do you think you may be pregnant?     Are you breast feeding?     Are you taking any other medicines?     IF THE ANSWER TO ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS IS YES:   Did you tell your doctor at the last visit or an earlier visit?   If you did   NOT   you should do so as soon as possible and before starting the tablets.   Even so, your doctor may still want you to take them.     Look at the label   It should say WHO should take them, HOW MANY and WHEN. If it does not or you are not sure, ask your doctor or pharmacist.   You may have been given a STEROID CARD which tells you how many tablets to take each day (see back of leaflet).   The tablets can be swallowed whole but they are best taken as a drink after allowing them to dissolve in a glass of water.   (If prescribed for a CHILD, make sure the tablets are taken as the label says).     After starting to take your tablets   You may start to feel better after taking the tablets for a few days but do not stop taking them unless your doctor tells you to. Most people taking this medicine find it causes no problems if taken at the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible time. As with most medicines a few people may find they have side effects to it.     What is in your tablets    Each small pink tablet contains:      The active ingredient - prednisolone (as sodium phosphate) 5mg   Other ingredients include povidone, sodium bicarbonate, sodium benzoate (E211), erythrosine (E127) and saccharin.    Side effects   Most people taking these tablets for a short time find they cause no problems.       If you have to take the tablets for more than two weeks:     Do not suddenly stop taking the tablets unless your doctor tells you to - you could become ill     Make sure your supply of tablets does not run out.     If you have to take these tablets for a long time your doctor will prescribe as small a dose as possible.   High   doses taken for a   long time   or repeated in short courses can lead to side effects such as skin thinning (stretch marks), eye problems (cataracts or glaucoma), bone thinning or damage, stomach ulcers, irregular monthly periods or rarely, mental upsets. In children high doses taken for a long time can stunt growth.   Tablets like these can make it easier for you to pick up infections and mild infections, such as chickenpox, can be made worse.   If you feel unwell or have any unusual discomfort you do not understand - tell your doctor.      Carrying a steroid card      If your doctor asks you to carry a STEROID CARD, be sure to keep it with you always.     Show it to any doctor, dentist, nurse or midwife or anyone else who is giving you treatment or vaccination.     Even after your treatment has finished tell any doctor, dentist, nurse or midwife or anyone else who is giving you treatment that you have had steroid treatment.     A steroid card may be obtained from your doctor, pharmacist or Local Family Health Service Authority. In Scotland, steroid cards are available from the Scottish Office of Home and Health.    What to do if you miss a dose   If you forget to take a dose, take another as soon as possible. Then go on as before.     What to do if you take too many tablets at once   It is very important to stick to the dose on the label of your medicine. Taking more than this could be dangerous especially if many tablets are taken at one time. In that case don't delay; ask your doctor what to do or contact your nearest hospital emergency department.     Breast feeding   If you are a nursing mother taking Prednesol Tablets, prednisolone will be in your breast milk. You should take this medicine ONLY when approved by your doctor.     If you do not get better If you have taken all the tablets and you still feel unwell or If you have not taken all the tablets but feel worse - Tell your doctor      ",

"    Climagest    The patient information leaflet for Climagest is in the form of a small booklet. The text below is the  information it contains.     What you should know about CLIMAGEST tablets   This leaflet contains information on your medication. You should read it before you start to take the tablets. The information given is not designed to replace your doctor's instructions, but to reinforce them. If you have any questions at all about your medication, please ask your doctor or pharmacist.     What is in your tablets?   CLIMAGEST tablets are available in two strengths, CLIMAGEST 1 mg tablets and CLIMAGEST 2mg tablets. Whichever strength you have been prescribed, each pack will contain two types of tablets. One type of tablet contains oestradiol valerate USP, an oestrogen made from plant sources, and the other type contains the oestrogen, oestradiol valerate USP in combination with the progestogen, norethisterone BP.   All of the tablets contain the following inactive ingredients: lactose, maize starch, povidone, talc (sterilised), magnesium stearate, E464, propylene glycol.   In addition the tablets contain the following colouring agents:   CLIMAGEST 1 mg - grey-blue tablets containing oestradiol valerate: E132, E171; white tablets containing oestradiol valerate and norethisterone: E171.   CLIMAGEST 2 mg - blue tablets containing oestradiol valerate: E132 and E171; pale yellow tablets containing oestradiol valerate and norethisterone: E171 and E172.   The difference in the colour of the tablets will help you to know which one of the two tablets contained in your pack you are taking.   CLIMAGEST 1 mg packs contain: 16 grey-blue tablets containing 1 mg oestradiol valerate which are marked E1 on one side and 12 white tablets containing 1 mg oestradiol valerate and 1 mg norethisterone which are marked N1 on one side.   CLIMAGEST 2 mg packs contain: 16 blue tablets containing 2 mg oestradiol valerate which are marked E2 on one side and 12 pale yellow tablets containing 2 mg oestradiol valerate and 1 mg norethisterone marked N2 on one side.   Both strengths are available as one or three month calendar packs, with each calendar pack containing 28 tablets.     How does CLIMAGEST work?   CLIMAGEST tablets contain the hormones oestradiol valerate and norethisterone. These hormones are designed to replace the hormones which are lost during the decline in the function of the ovaries after the menopause. Tablets of this kind are often known as Hormone Replacement Therapy or HRT.     Who makes CLIMAGEST?   The licence for CLIMAGEST is held by Sandoz Pharmaceuticals (UK) Ltd. Frimley Business Park, Frimley, Camberley, Surrey, GU16 5SG.   CLIMAGEST tablets are made in the United Kingdom by: Medevale Pharmaservices Ltd. Ashton-Under-Lyne, England.     What is CLIMAGEST for?   In middle age, typically between the ages of 45 and 55, a natural process occurs in women, during which the levels of female hormones found in the body decline. These hormones are produced by the ovaries and at the end of this process, which is often called the 'change of life', climacteric or menopause, the ovaries cease to function.   In some women, the drop in hormone levels causes certain symptoms, the best known of which are hot flushes, sweating, tiredness, sleeplessness and depression. Other symptoms include dizziness, head- ache, palpitations (flutterings in the chest), tingling in the hands and feet and discomfort during sexual intercourse.   Few women will have all of these symptoms and the number, frequency, severity and duration of them varies from one woman to another.   CLIMAGEST is designed to relieve the symptoms associated with the menopause by replacing the hormones lost during the decline in the function of the ovaries. You will still have a regular monthly bleed or period, much like before your menopause.     Before taking your CLIMAGEST tablets   You should read this section carefully because there are some conditions your doctor should know about before you start your treatment. Ask yourself the following questions before you start to take your tablets. Have you ever suffered or do you currently suffer from:   Liver problems, for example jaundice.   Heart or kidney disease.   Clotting in blood vessels (the medical term for this is thromboembolism) e.g. in the legs or lungs, heart attack or stroke.   Persistent irregular bleeding from the vagina.    Any condition affected by hormones e.g. tumours of the breast or womb   Remember, tell your doctor or pharmacist, if the answer is yes to any of these questions.   You should not take CLIMAGEST if you are pregnant or if you think you are pregnant and you should not breast feed while taking it.   If you are unsure about anything, ask for advice from your doctor or pharmacist.      Are you taking any other medicine?   The hormones in CLIMAGEST supplement your own natural hormones and are unlikely to react with other medicines. However, you should always tell your doctor about any other medicines you are taking, including ones you have bought yourself.     Accidents, illnesses and operations   Your doctor may stop your CLIMAGEST tablets if you are about to have an operation or if you suffer an injury or illness where there may be an increased risk of blood clotting or if your blood pressure rises significantly for the first time.     Check ups whilst taking CLIMAGEST   While you are taking Climagest you should see your doctor regularly, at least every 6 to 12 months. You should have a thorough internal (vaginal) and physical examination before and at regular times during your treatment.   If you have mild chronic liver disease, your liver function will be checked every 8-12 weeks. Your doctor will also keep a closer eye on you if you suffer from gallstones or some diseases, including multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, migraine, diabetes, high blood pressure, hearing impairment due to bone deposits in the ear, tetany, uterine fibroids, and porphyria.   You will also be monitored and receive regular checks from your doctor if you have any significant kidney or heart impairment.   If you have had or currently suffer from breast nodules or fibrocystic disease your doctor may want to keep a careful check on you.   It is recommended that all women regularly check their breasts. HRT may increase the risk of breast cancer very slightly if it is used for longer than five years, so it is especially important to check your breasts regularly. If you do not know how to do this yourself, your doctor or practice nurse can show you how. They may also check your breasts for you at your regular appointments and in addition, you may also have a breast scan (a 'mammography') at your doctor's surgery or at hospital.     Contraception whilst taking CLIMAGEST   CLIMAGEST is not intended to be used as an oral contraceptive.   If you are using an oral or other hormonal contraceptive, e.g. the 'pill' or depot injection, you must  change to a non-hormonal contraceptive, for example a diaphragm or condom, BEFORE starting CLIMAGEST.   If your doctor has already told you that you no longer need to use any form of contraception, you do not need to do so whilst taking CLIMAGEST even if you experience monthly bleeding.     How do you take CLIMAGEST?   Whether you are taking CLIMAGEST 1 mg or CLIMAGEST 2 mg tablets, you should take one tablet each day.   If you are still having periods (monthly bleeds) it is advisable to take the first tablet on the first day of your period unless your doctor tells you otherwise. If however your periods are infrequent, or have stopped, your doctor may suggest you start immediately.   The pack has been designed specifically to help you take the tablets correctly.   Remove the tablets from the foil as shown in the picture.    You should take one tablet each day by following the sequence of numbers and arrows below each tablet.   Swallow your tablets whole with a glass of water.   The tablets are best taken at the same time every day, try to get into a routine.   You should start your next pack of CLIMAGEST IMMEDIATELY after you have finished this one, whether you have any bleeding or not.   You should follow your doctor's instructions as to how and when you should take CLIMAGEST tablets and never change the dose yourself, however well you feel. If you are unsure about how much medicine to take or when to take it ask your doctor or pharmacist.     How long should you take CLIMAGEST for?   Your doctor will advise you how long to carry on with your treatment. Many women use Hormone Replacement Therapy for several years.     What to do if you take too many tablets?   If you accidentally take too much of your medicine try not to worry but you should seek advice from a doctor as soon as possible.     What to do if you forget to take a tablet?   If you forget to take a tablet at your usual time try to take it within 12 hours. If this is not possible leave the forgotten tablet and continue to take the remaining tablets at the usual time.     Does CLIMAGEST have side effects?   Most people who are prescribed CLIMAGEST will benefit from taking it but some people can be upset  by it. If you suffer from either of the following, stop treatment and tell your doctor or pharmacist as soon  as possible: migraine or unusually severe headaches; jaundice.   Other effects of taking CLIMAGEST can be: breast tenderness; nausea; headaches; indigestion; wind; vomiting; abdominal or stomach cramps; bloating; weight gain; palpitations or flutterings in the chest; changes in sexual desire, dizziness; vertigo; nose bleeds; biliary stasis which is a decrease or stoppage in the flow of bile; high blood pressure; general itchiness or rash; inflammation of a vein associated with blood clots; vaginal discharge.   If any side effects worry you or do not go away, talk to your doctor. If you notice any other unexpected symptoms, even if they are not listed hear tell your doctor.     Bleeding whilst taking CLIMAGEST   Whether you are still having periods or not CLIMAGEST will usually cause you to bleed during the week after you have completed each pack, i.e. the first week of your new pack. This may not always be the case, but you should have a bleed at the same time each monthly cycle.   When treatment with CLIMAGEST is first started you may have some irregular bleeding. This is common during the first few months. It is usually temporary and wears off with time, however if it persists you should tell your doctor.   As with normal periods the amount of bleeding will vary from one woman to another but is not usually heavy.     Looking after your tablets   Keep the tablets in their pack and only take them out when it is time to take your medicine.   There is an expire or 'use by' date printed on the pack and carton of your tablets. Do not take the tablets after this date.   You should always keep your tablets in a safe place out of reach of children. Store below 25ºC in a dry place protected from light.   If your doctor decides to stop treatment you should return any leftover medicine to your pharmacist. Only keep it if your doctor tells you to.   This leaflet was last revised in November 1995.

"      WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT   Please read this leaflet carefully before you start to take this medicine, even if you have taken   NEORAL   Oral Solution before. You will notice that the advice contained in this leaflet may vary depending on whether you are receiving the drug for transplantation or taking it for your skin condition or as treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. If you have any questions or are unsure about anything, ask your doctor or pharmacist (chemist) for advice.    WHAT'S IN YOUR MEDICINE   NEORAL Oral Solution is a clear, faintly yellow to faintly brownish yellow liquid containing 100mg cyclosporin per ml.   It also contains the following inactive ingredients: DL-a    NEORAL   Oral Solution is available in 50ml bottles.   The name of your medicine is   NEORAL   and it contains cyclosporin. It is one of a group of drugs known as immunosuppressive agents. These drugs are used to dampen down the body's immune reactions.     NEORAL Oral Solution is manufactured by:Product Licence Holder:    WHY DOES YOUR DOCTOR WANT YOU   If you have received an organ or bone marrow transplant   Although you may have undergone a series of tests before your organ or bone marrow transplant to ensure that the match between your body and the transplanted organ or bone marrow was as close as possible, the donor tissue will still not be identical to your tissue. As a result, your body's immune system will try to reject the donor tissue.   NEORAL   helps to stop this rejection response by blocking the development of special cells which would normally attack the transplanted tissue.     If you have a severe skin complaint   Some skin conditions, such as severe psoriasis or eczema (severe atopic dermatitis) are thought to be caused by your immune system over-reacting.   NEORAL   may help to stop this by suppressing your immune system, thereby improving your skin condition.     If you have severe rheumatoid arthritis   It is thought that rheumatoid arthritis may be caused by inappropriate immune responses in your body.   NEORAL   may help to stop this by suppressing your immune system, thereby improving your rheumatoid arthritis.     If you were previously taking SANDIMMUN (cyclosporin) Soft Gelatin Capsules or Oral Solution   NEORAL and   SANDIMMUN   both contain cyclosporin as the active ingredient. However,   NEORAL   is an improved formulation of cyclosporin and is, therefore, different to   SANDIMMUN  .   Because of this difference, the absorption of cyclosporin into your blood should be much more reliable with   NEORAL  . Absorption of cyclosporin with   NEORAL   Soft Gelatin Capsules is much less likely to be affected by taking it with food, again resulting in more consistent levels of cyclosporin in your blood. This is thought to be of particular importance in the prevention of rejection following transplantation, especially in the longer term.   Because of the difference in absorption of cyclosporin, your doctor will probably want to monitor you more closely for a short period following transfer from   SANDIMMUN   to   NEORAL  , to make sure that you get the ideal dose for you. If your doctor transfers you from   SANDIMMUN   to   NEORAL  , you should not go back to taking   SANDIMMUN   unless your doctor tells you to. If you were previously using   SANDIMMUN   and your doctor has now transferred you to   NEORAL  , any unused   SANDIMMUN   that you have got left over should be returned to your pharmacist.       BEFORE USING YOUR MEDICINE   Tell your doctor before you start taking   NEORAL   Oral Solution if the answer to any of the following questions is 'yes':     Do you suspect that you have had an allergic reaction to, or been upset by any of the ingredients in   NEORAL   (listed in 'What's in your medicine')?     Do you have any kidney problems or have you had any disease which may have affected your kidneys?     Do you have high blood pressure?     Do you have an infection of any type?     Have you been told that you have any kind of tumour?     Do you have any liver problems or have you had any disease which may have affected your liver?     Have you been told that you have high levels of potassium in your blood or that you have gout?     Do you have any skin conditions other than severe psoriasis or eczema?     Are you taking any other medicines (either bought or prescribed)? Some medicines can interfere with your treatment, so make sure to check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking any other medicines. In particular, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following:     antibiotics or antifungal medicines for treatment of infections     oral contraceptive tablets     any medicines for heart problems or high blood pressure     anti-epileptic medicines     cholesterol lowering medicines     other immunosuppressive medicines (e.g. prednisolone)     sleeping tablets     potassium supplements     medicines to encourage urination     anti-inflammatory medicines (i.e. NSAIDs) e.g. diclofenac     light treatment (PUVA or other UV treatment) for your skin condition     colchicine     Are you pregnant, or planning to become pregnant? If you do become pregnant whilst taking   NEORAL  , tell your doctor.     Are you breast feeding?     Have you recently received any vaccinations or are you planning to have any vaccinations?     Are you likely to be exposed to the sun a great deal without protecting your skin with a sun block cream?     Do you regularly use a sunbed?     Has the medicine been prescribed for the treatment of eczema in someone who is less than f 6 years of age?     Has the medicine been prescribed for the treatment of severe rheumatoid arthritis in someone who is less than 18 years of age?     Has the medicine been prescribed for the treatment of severe rheumatoid arthritis in someone who is less than 18 years of age?     TAKING YOUR MEDICINE   Your doctor will work out the correct dose of   NEORAL   for you depending on your body weight and whether you are taking   NEORAL   following a transplant or as a treatment for severe psoriasis, eczema or rheumatoid arthritis. Your doctor will also tell you how often to take your medicine.   If you have had an organ or bone marrow transplant the total dose is usually within the range of 2mg/kg body weight per day and 15 mg/kg body weight per day. Generally, the higher doses are used just after transplantation and the lower doses are used once your transplanted organ or bone marrow has stabilised. Your doctor will adjust your dose to one that is ideal for you. To do this, he may need to do some blood tests.   For the treatment of severe psoriasis and eczema the total dose is usually within the range of 2.5mg/kg body weight per day and 5.0mg/kg body weight per day.   For the treatment of severe rheumatoid arthritis, the total daily dose is usually within the range of 2.5mg/kg body weight per day and 4.0mg/kg body weight per day.   Your doctor will tell you how much   NEORAL   to take and how long you will need to take   NEORAL   for, depending on whether you are taking   NEORAL   following transplantation, or for the treatment of a severe skin condition, or rheumatoid arthritis. For the treatment of severe eczema, treatment usually lasts for 8 weeks.     Follow your doctor's instructions exactly and never change the dose yourself, however well you feel.   Do not stop taking your medicine unless your doctor tells you to, however well you feel.   Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure about how much medicine to take or when to take it.   Your pack of   NEORAL   contains a bottle of medicine, a cap, an oral syringe and a tube with attached white stopper.   When you open your medicine for the first time follow the instructions below:-       1. Raise flap in centre of metal sealing ring.      2. Tear off sealing ring completely.       3. Remove black rubber stopper from bottle and dispose of carefully.      4. Take tube with attached white stopper from case and insert into bottle, pushing stopper firmly into the neck.       5. Pour about 50ml (1/2 cup) of orange or apple juice (see below) into a clean glass or cup. Insert nozzle of syringe into stopper.      6. Draw up the plunger until the medicine rises up the syringe to the dosage level prescribed by your doctor.       7. If any large bubbles appear slowly press plunger all the way down and then draw the medicine up again to the dosage level prescribed. The presence of a few tiny bubbles is not important and will not affect the dose in any way.   Hold the syringe above the orange or apple juice and press the plunger.   Stir well and drink at once.   Do not leave the mixture to stand.       8. Do not wash the syringe. After use, wipe the outside with a clean tissue and return syringe to its cover. Dispose of the tissue carefully.   The white stopper and tube should remain in the bottle.   Close bottle with cap provided.     The next time you use your medicine start at Point 5.   For improved taste, the solution can be diluted with orange juice or squash or apple juice. However, it may also be taken with water if preferred.   Grapefruit juice should not be used  . In addition, do not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice for 1 hour before taking your dose as it may interfere with your medicine.    NEORAL   Oral Solution has a characteristic taste which is different to that of   SANDIMMUN   Oral Solution.     MISSED DOSE   If you forget to take a dose take another one as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Then go on as before.     OVERDOSE   If you accidentally take too much of your medicine, tell your doctor immediately, or go to your nearest Casualty Department.     AFTER TAKING YOUR MEDICINE   Most people benefit from taking this medicine, but a few people can be upset by it.   Once the ideal dose of   NEORAL   has been established, the number of side-effects with   NEORAL   is generally similar to that reported with   SANDIMMUN   Oral Solution and Soft Gelatin Capsules.   The dose of this medicine needs to be carefully adjusted by your doctor. Too much can affect the kidneys. You will, therefore, have regular blood tests and visits to the hospital, particularly after transplantation. Your blood pressure will also be measured regularly. These visits will give you the chance to talk to your doctor about your treatment and mention any problems you are having.   If you develop a sore throat, any infections or begin to feel generally unwell see your doctor immediately.   Side-effects that have sometimes been reported in patients taking cyclosporin include shakiness of the hands, upset stomach or abdominal pain, swollen gums, increased growth of hair on the body or face, high blood pressure, liver problems, tiredness, and sensations of heat in the hands and feet.   More rarely, headaches, skin rash, increased weight, fluid retention, confusion, feelings of numbness or tingling, muscle weakness or cramps, fits, gout, raised cholesterol levels, slight swelling of the breast tissue, changes in the menstrual period in women and tumours have also been reported.   In liver transplant patients vision and movement disturbances, and loss of concentration have also been reported as side-effects. However, although these effects have been reported in patients taking cyclosporin, they may not have actually been due to the medicine.   Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you suffer from any of these effects, or from any other side-effects not mentioned in this leaflet.     STORING YOUR MEDICINE   Store your   NEORAL   Oral Solution below 30 degrees centigrade.   Do not store your   NEORAL   Oral Solution in the fridge.   If you store your   NEORAL   Oral Solution at temperatures lower than 15 degrees centigrade, it may gel and/or you may be able to see small flakes in it. These should disappear if the medicine is allowed to warm up to room temperature and it should not affect the quality of your medicine.   Do not use the medicine more than 2 months after opening the bottle.   Store your medicine in a safe place where children cannot reach it. Your medicine could harm them.   Do not use this medicine after the expiry date shown on the bottle label.   If your doctor decides to stop your treatment, return any leftover medicine to the pharmacist.

"      Nuvelle™   The patient information leaflet for Nuvelle is in the form of a small booklet The text below is the information for patients that it contains    Please read this booklet carefully before you start your medicine.    This booklet only provides a summary of the information available on your medicine. If you have any questions or are not sure about anything ask your doctor or pharmacist.   The reason why you can only get this medicine with a doctor's prescription is that its use needs medical supervision.   Please tell your doctor if you have any doubts or worries about taking this medicine, either before you start or while you are taking it.    What 'the change of life' means   'The change of life' (a/so known as 'the climacteric') is a gradual process, which usually takes place between the ages of about 45 and 55. The periods usually become irregular, both in timing and amount of bleeding, before they stop altogether, but the time at which the periods finally stop - 'the menopause' is not the end of the change of life, which always continues for some time afterwards.   Although the change of life is natural, it often causes distressing symptoms. These symptoms are due to the gradual loss of the female sex hormones produced by the ovaries.   In addition the loss of these hormones may, in some women, lead to thinning of the bones (osteoporosis) in later life.    The name of your medicine is: Nuvelle     What does Nuvelle contain?   Each pack of Nuvelle has 16 white tablets each containing 2 mg oestradiol (estradiol) valerate and 12 pink tablets each containing 2 mg oestradiol (estradiol) valerate and 75 micrograms levonorgestrel.   Nuvelle also contains the inactive ingredients: lactose, maize starch, povidone 25,000, povidone 700,000, magnesium stearate (E572) sucrose, macrogol 6000 (polyethylene glycol 6000) calcium carbonate (E170), glycerol (E422), talc, montan glycol wax, titanium dioxide (E171), yellow and red ferric oxide pigments (E172).   Each pack of Nuvelle contains 3 memo packs (strips) of 28 tablets. Packs containing 1 memo strip of 28 tablets are also available to doctors.   Nuvelle is a hormone replacement therapy.    The product licence is held by   Schering Health Care Ltd, The Brow, Burgess Hill, West Sussex RH15 9NE.   Nuvelle is manufactured by Schering AG, Berlin, Germany.     How Nuvelle helps you through the 'change of life'   Nuvelle contains both types of hormone that are lost during the change of life: oestrogen and progestogen. Therefore, it replaces the hormones that the body no longer makes, and prevents or relieves the troublesome symptoms. Nuvelle is also designed to control heavy or irregular periods, and is likely to produce regular monthly bleeding even if you have already passed the menopause. Nuvelle will not make you able to have children, but, on the other hand, if you are still fertile, Nuvelle will not prevent pregnancy.   Some women are more likely than others to develop osteoporosis in later life depending on their medical history and lifestyle. If it is appropriate you may be prescribed Nuvelle to prevent osteoporosis. Your doctor will be able to advise you further.      Reasons for not taking Nuvelle   Before taking Nuvelle tell your doctor if you are pregnant or breast feeding or have any of the following: clots in the blood vessels (thrombotic disorders) or a history of these conditions; severe diabetes with changes to the blood vessels; abnormal red blood cells (sickle-cell anaemia); high blood fats (disorders of lipid metabolism); existing or treated hormone-dependent tumours of the breast or of the lining of the womb (mammary or endometrial carcinoma), undiagnosed irregular vaginal bleeding, a history during pregnancy of (1) itching of the whole body (pruritus of pregnancy), (2) the blister-like rash known as herpes gestationis (most commonly on the palms and soles), (3) deterioration of inherited deafness (otosclerosis), or (4) jaundice not explained by infections, poisons or obstruction of the flow of bile (idiopathic jaundice of pregnancy); other types of idiopathic jaundice (Dubin-Johnson or Rotor syndromes); severe disturbances of liver function; previous or existing liver tumours, lumpy, painful breasts (mastopathy), the presence of tissue of the lining of the womb in places of the body where it is not normally found (endometriosis).     What you should know before taking Nuvelle   Diseases that are known to get worse during pregnancy might behave similarly during treatment, and require careful observation while you are taking Nuvelle (e.g. the disease of the nervous system called multiple sclerosis, fits(epilepsy),diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension), lumpy or painful breasts (benign breast disease), certain types of heart or kidney disease, asthma, tetany and inherited deafness (otosclerosis) and the inherited disease called porphyria).   Substances such as those contained in Nuvelle (steroids) may cause jaundice in people who have an inherited abnormality of bile excretion.   Your doctor will carry out gynaecological, blood pressure and other examinations as appropriate, e.g. if you are known to have any liver disease, your doctor will arrange for your liver function to be checked periodically.   Your doctor will examine your breasts periodically during treatment, particularly if there is a history of breast cancer in your family.   During or after the use of hormones such as are contained in Nuvelle, benign liver tumours have rarely occurred, and even more rarely malignant liver tumours. In isolated cases, bleeding from such tumours into the abdominal cavity has endangered life.   Although such events are extremely improbable with Nuvelle, you should inform your doctor about any unusual feelings in your upper abdomen that do not disappear within a short time.     Nuvelle is not an oral contraceptive   It is important to note that Nuvelle is not an oral contraceptive. If you still have the ability to become pregnant, Nuvelle is unlikely to alter it. If you are taking contraceptive precautions other than oral (or other hormonal) contraceptives when you start Nuvelle, continue to do so until your doctor tells you that you no longer require contraceptive protection. If you have been taking an oral (or other hormonal) contraceptive, you must change to an alternative (non-hormonal) form of contraception before starting Nuvelle. On the other hand, if your doctor has already advised you that you need no longer use any contraceptive you need not do so while taking Nuvelle, despite the fact that you again have regular monthly bleeding.    Reasons for stopping Nuvelle immediately   There is not known to be any increased risk of blood-clotting (thrombosis) during the use of Nuvelle. However, it should not be used if thrombosis is present, and as a precaution you are therefore advised to stop taking Nuvelle at once and consult your doctor if you experience any of the following: the very first attack of migraine (typically a throbbing headache continued   and nausea, preceded by visual disturbances) that you have ever experienced; worsening of pre-existing migraine; any unusually frequent or unusually severe headaches- sudden disturbance of vision or hearing inflamed veins (phlebitis), pains in the chest o; abdomen- swelling in the limbs; pain, tingling or numbness in any part of the body; unexplained cough; breathlessness; pain on breathing.   If you have any of the symptoms listed above you should stop taking the tablets and contact your doctor at once.   Nuvelle must also be stopped at once if you become pregnant, or if you develop jaundice, or your doctor finds your blood-pressure to be significantly raised or if you notice an increase in epileptic seizures.   If you have fibroids of the womb these may grow during treatment. You should stop taking Nuvelle if your doctor finds this has happened.   Ask your doctor for advice on whether you should stop taking the tablets if you are confined to bed, or have an accident or illness, or you need an operation.    What to do if . . .      You are taking other medicines at the same time as Nuvelle     Some drugs e.g. antibiotics and antiepileptics may reduce the effectiveness of Nuvelle.     If you have to take other medicines regularly, you should inform your doctor.     If you are diabetic your doctor may alter the dose of medicine required to treat your diabetes.

How to take Nuvelle   About the pack The pack of Nuvelle is designed to help you remember to take your medicine. To use it you must first know the day of the week on which you will take the first tablet. If you are still having periods, take the first tablet on the fifth day of your period, whether the period has finished or not. If your periods have become infrequent or have stopped altogether, your Figure 1  Figure 2   doctor may have advised you to start immediately. In addition to the memo-pack (which contains the tablets), the outer carton contains seven self-adhesive strips showing the days of the week. Each strip starts with a different day of the week. Peel the strip that ;tarts with your starting day off the backing.   For instance, if you start the tablets on a Wednesday, se the strip that starts with 'Wed' (see Figure 1).   Stick the strip along the top of the memo-pack on he clear side, where the tablets are visible, so that the first day is above the white tablet to which the arrow marked 'Start' is pointing (see Figure 2)   You can now see on which day you have to take each tablet (Figure 3). Take one tablet each day, following the directions of the arrows, until you have finished all 28 tablets in the pack. This means that you will be taking one white tablet daily for the first 16 lays and then one pink tablet daily for the following 12 days. If, at any time, you are in doubt whether you lave taken your tablet, a glance at the appropriate lay on the memo-pack will tell you.    Figure 2     It is best to take your tablet at the same time each day, preferably after a meal. The tablet should be swallowed whole, with a glass of water or milk.   When you have finished each pack, start the next pack on the following day. Never leave a break between packs. Tablet-taking should be continuous. Bleeding may occur 2-3 days after the end of each pack.    What to do if . . .     . . . you forget to take a tablet.      If you are less than 12 hours late, take it as soon as possible, and take the next one at your normal time.     But if you are more than   twelve hours   late, leave the forgotten tablet in the pack. Continue to take the remaining tablets at the usual time on the right days.      What to do if . . .       . . . you take too many tablets at once     There have been no reports of ill-effects from overdosage. You should consult your doctor who will be able to advise you what action, if any, is necessary.       . . . your bleeding pattern seems different     If you are still menstruating, you will probably have bleeding regularly, 2-3 days after finishing each pack of Nuvelle. If you miss a period, the possibility of pregnancy should be ruled out. Ask your doctor what to do.     If you have finished your periods, Nuvelle will probably cause you to bleed again after the end of each pack, but may not always do so.     If bleeding starts at any time except the week after you have finished a pack, let your doctor know. It is not necessary to stop tablet-taking unless your doctor says so.     Just as with normal periods, the amount of bleeding with Nuvelle varies from woman to woman. Usually the bleeding is not unduly heavy, and it may even be rather scanty, but this is not important as far as the   treatment is concerned. If you have recently had very light, short periods, you may have rather heavier bleedings with Nuvelle.     Side-effects   During the first few months of treatment you may experience some vaginal bleeding at unexpected times (breakthrough bleeding and spotting) and some breast tenderness or enlargement. These are usually temporary and normally disappear with continued treatment. If they don't, contact your doctor.   The following symptoms, which may or may not have been caused by Nuvelle, and which in some cases were probably symptoms of the change of life have been reported: indigestion, nausea, vomiting bloated stomach, increased appetite, increased o; reduced weight, leg pains, fluid retention, palpitations, dizziness, anxiety, headaches, migraine, depressive moods, rashes, altered sexual interest, yellow brown patches on the skin (chloasma).   Tell your doctor if you have any of these symptoms, or, indeed, any other symptoms, while you are taking Nuvelle.     Expiry date:   The expiry date for this pack of medicine is printed on the label. Do not use the pills after this date.    Storage:   Keep out of the reach of children.    Date of last revision of this booklet:   17 January 1996.   Product Licence number: 0053/0219.

"    Your Prescription for Retrovir™   Tablets (zidovudine)    Glaxo Wellcome   Please read this carefully before starting treatment. If you have any doubts or worries, or you are simply   not sure about something, ask your doctor.     What's in your medicine?   Each white round tablet contains 300mg (marked ""WELLCOME X4F"") of the active ingredient zidovudine.    Retrovir   Tablets also contain some inactive ingredients. These are: microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycollate, povidone K30, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, titanium dioxide, polyethylene glycol 400 and polyethylene glycol 8000.    Retrovir   300mg Tablets come in packs of 60 tablets.    Who makes your medicine?   Glaxo Wellcome Operations, Greenford, Middlesex, UB6 0NN makes Retrovir Tablets. Glaxo Wellcome, Stockley Park,   Middlesex, U811 1BT is licensed to sell them in the UK.     What is Retrovir treatment and how does it work?    Retrovir   suffering from progressive HIV infection and those who have gone on to develop the symptoms of AIDS. In order to understand how   Retrovir   works, it will help you to know how HIV multiplies within the body.   HIV reproduces itself by entering CD4 cells (important cells in your immune system) and turns them into 'mini factories' producing more viruses which, in turn, infect more cells. The CD4 cell dies when the new HIV viruses are released. If this process goes untreated, eventually there are too few CD4 cells left to fight off diseases and infections - a condition which usually leads to AIDS.    Retrovir   does not kill HIV, but works by entering the CD4 cells infected with it, helping to stop the production of new viruses and their despatch to other cells.   Retrovir   therefore helps to preserve your ability to resist disease by helping to prevent further deterioration of the immune system.    Questions you should ask yourself before taking Retrovir:     Do you have any blood disorder, eg anaemia?     Do you have liver or kidney disease?     Have you previously had an allergic reaction to   Retrovir   or zidovudine?     If the answer is ""YES"" to any of these questions, and if you have not already discussed them with your doctor, go back to him BEFORE starting treatment.      What about Retrovir in pregnancy?     HIV positive women who become pregnant, who are thinking of having a child or who are breast feeding should always discuss this with their doctor.      Retrovir   can be taken by HlV-positive pregnant women (after the first three months of pregnancy) to reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to their unborn child.   Retrovir   is given to the woman up to and during labour and is stopped after delivery. It is also given to the new born baby for the first six weeks of life.     It is important to carefully weigh the benefit of reducing the risk of HIV infection against the unknown possibility of the infant experiencing side effects in later life. If you are taking   Retrovir   to reduce the risk of having an infected baby, please discuss any concerns that you may have with your doctor.       Can I take other medication while I am taking Retrovir?     As part of your treatment, your doctor may offer you other medication. These will be all right to take along with   Retrovir   as long as your doctor knows about your condition and any medicines you are taking.      Retrovir   may interact with certain medicines, these may make side effects worse. It is important that you tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines (ask your doctor if you are not sure)     Phenytoin, ribavirin and probenecid     Paracetamol, aspirin, codeine, morphine, indomethacin, ketoprofen, naproxen, oxazepam, lorazepam, cimetidine, clofibrate, dapsone and isoprinosine.     Pentamidine, pyrimethamine, co-trimaxazole, amphotericin, flucytosine, ganciclovir, interferon, vincristine, vinblastine and doxorubicin.     In patients who take vitamin supplements, herbal remedies or homeopathic medicines only a few side-effects have bean seen, so if you feel benefit from these, continue taking them but keep your doctor informed.       Is it safe to drink alcohol whilst on treatment?     Alcohol can affect your response to many medications and you should discuss this matter in more detail with your doctor who will be familiar with your own particular case.       How do you take Retrovir?   It is important to take your medicine in the way your doctor has told you to. The label on your pack should tell you how many tablets to take and how often to take them. If the label doesn't say, or if you are not sure, ask your doctor or pharmacist.     The dose prescribed will vary from patient to patient and will depend on a number of factors, including the stage of infection. Your doctor will decide the most appropriate dosage for you (this may be between 500 mg and 1000mg per day).     Swallow the tablets whole with some water.     If you forget to take a dose, don't worry. Simply take h as soon as you remember and then continue as before. If you think you may have difficulty in remembering to take your tablets at the times specified, it's a good idea to use a pocket timer or wrist-watch alarm to remind you.     If you take a larger dose than prescribed this is not likely to cause you any harm, but you should let your doctor know as soon as possible if this happens.     If someone else takes your medicine by mistake, tell your doctor at once.     Because your medicine controls and does not cure your condition, you will normally need to take it continually. You should not stop treatment unless your doctor tells you to.     Remember that treatment with   Retrovir   does not reduce the risk of passing HIV on to others by sexual contact or blood transfer. You will still remain infectious while taking   Retrovir  .       Does Retrovir have side effects?    Retrovir     The first can occur during the first 4 to 5 weeks of treatment and consists of nausea, vomiting and headache. Very rarely, muscular aches and a rash may also develop. In the vast majority of cases, all these effects disappear on their own after a few weeks, a fact worth bearing in mind if you experience them. Check with your doctor if they do not go away or become distressing.     The second can develop after four to six weeks of treatment and affects your bone marrow's production of blood cells. Most commonly, production of red blood cells is reduced, resulting in anaemia. If this happens, the symptoms are tiredness and shortness of breath. Also, less commonly, the production of a type of white blood cell may be reduced which can make you more prone to infections. Studies have shown that these side effects occur in 5% or less of patients being treated for early HIV infection, although they may be more common in patients with AIDS.

HOW DO YOUR TABLETS WORK?   ‘Cozaar’ belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. Angiotensin II is a chemical occurring in the body,   which tightens your blood vessels making it harder for the blood to pass through them and causing your blood pressure to increase. ‘Cozaar’ blocks this effect of angiotensin II, causing the blood vessels to relax, and so lowers your blood pressure.     WHO MAKES YOUR TABLETS?   Your tablets are made by Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited, Hertford Road, Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, UK, who hold the Product Licence in the UK.     WHY DO YOU NEED TO TAKE THESE TABLETS?   Your doctor has prescribed ‘Cozaar’ because you have a condition known as hypertension or high blood pressure       Blood pressure is the term given to the pressure produced by your heart pumping blood to all parts of your body. Your blood pressure is measured by two numbers, e.g. 120/80 mm Hg. The top number measures the pressure while your heart beats and the bottom number measures the pressure in between heart beats.   Normal blood pressure is part of good health. High blood pressure is caused when the blood vessels tighten and the measurement goes above the normal range for your age. There are usually no symptoms of high blood pressure and you will only know you have it if you have had your blood pressure measured.   Although you might feel quite well, if your high blood pressure is not treated, it can damage your heart and kidneys, and in some cases lead to strokes, heart attacks, heart and kidney failure, or blindness High blood pressure can be treated and controlled with medicines such as ‘Cozaar’ . Your doctor may also recommend that you make some changes to your lifestyle to help your high blood pressure, such as losing weight, avoiding alcohol and smoking, and reducing the amount of salt in your diet. Your doctor may also encourage you to take more mild exercise    ARE THERE PATIENTS WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE THESE TABLETS?

"    Please read this leaflet carefully.     SANDOGLOBULIN 1g   Freeze-dried, human normal immunoglobulin for preparation of a solution for intravenous infusion.    Reconstitution   Prepare solution immediately before use.   To prepare a   3% solution   – dissolve the entire contents of the   Sandoglobulin   bottle in 33 ml 0.9% w/v normal saline.      Reconstitution           1. Tear off the protective caps from the sterile saline for injection and   Sandoglobulin   bottles. Disinfect both rubber stoppers.       2. Remove the protective cover from one end of the transfer set and insert the spike through the rubber stopper of the bottle of   saline  .   3. Remove the protective cover from the other end of the transfer set. Lift both bottles,   holding at a slight angle to the work surface  , and insert spike into the   Sandoglobulin   bottle.       4. Invert the bottles so that the saline flows into the   Sandoglobulin   bottle.   Turn both bottles vertically so that the   Sandoglobulin   is on the bottom and the saline is on top.   Hold both bottles firmly to prevent loss of vacuum while the saline is drawn into the   Sandoglobulin   bottle. In this manner the vacuum in the   Sandoglobulin   bottle, together with gravity, works to accelerate the rate of saline transfer.       5. Once the saline is transferred, lift the saline bottle off the spike to release the vacuum. This will reduce foaming and facilitate dissolution.   Remove the spike.   The powder should dissolve within a few minutes to form an opalescent solution.   In exceptional cases, dissolution may take up to 20 minutes. It is important that all particles of   Sandoglobulin   are completely dissolved and no clumps remain.   You can help this process by gently swirling the bottle but   DO NOT SHAKE  . Shaking can cause foaming and particle formation, both of which can impede the dissolving and administration process.

"      Fosamax (alendronate sodium)    Please read all of this leaflet carefully before you start to take your tablets, even if you have just had a repeat prescription. Some of the information in your previous leaflet may have changed.    IT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO READ THE SECTION ‘HOW SHOULD YOU TAKE FOSAMAX?’ BEFORE TAKING THIS MEDICINE.    Keep this leaflet You may want to read it again.     What is in your tablets?    Active ingredient   The active ingredient in Fosamax Tablets is alendronate sodium. Fosamax is available as round white tablets each containing alendronate sodium, equivalent to 10 mg alendronic acid.     Other ingredients   Microcrystalline cellulose EP, anhydrous lactose USNF, croscarmellose sodium USNF, and magnesium stearate E P.   Fosamax Tablets are supplied in blister packs of 28 tablets.      How do your tablets work?   Fosamax belongs to a group of non-hormonal medicines called aminobisphosphonates. Fosamax stops the loss of bone that occurs in women after they have been through the menopause, and helps to rebuild bone.     Who makes your tablets?   Your tablets are made by Merck Sharp & Dohme (Italia)SpA, Via Emilia 21, 27100 Pavia, ltaly, for Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited, Hertford Road, Hoddesdon Hertfordshire, UK, who hold the Product Licence in the UK and the Product Authorisation in Ireland.     Why do you need to take Fosamax?   Your doctor has prescribed Fosamax because you have a disease called osteoporosis.   Osteoporosis is a thinning and weakening of the bones that is common in post-menopausal women. Following the menopause, the ovaries stop producing the female hormone, oestrogen. At this time, bone loss occurs and bones become weaker. The earlier a woman reaches the menopause, the greater the risk of osteoporosis.   Early on, osteoporosis usually has no symptoms. If left untreated, however, it can result in fractures (broken bones). Although fractures usually cause pain, fractures of the bones of the spine may go unnoticed until they cause height loss. Fractures may occur during normal, everyday activity, such as lifting, or from minor injury that would not be sufficient to fracture normal bone. Fractures usually occur at the hip, spine, or wrist and can lead not only to pain but also to considerable deformity and disability (such as stooped posture, or 'dowager's hump', and loss of mobility).     How can osteoporosis be treated?   It is important to remember that osteoporosis can be treated and that it is never too late to begin. Your doctor has prescribed Fosamax to treat your osteoporosis. Fosamax not only prevents the loss of bone but actually helps to rebuild bone.   In addition to your treatment with Fosamax, your doctor may recommend that you make some changes to your lifestyle which should help your condition. These are:    Stopping smoking  . Smoking appears to increase the rate at which you lose bone and, therefore, may increase your risk of fracture.    Exercise  . Like muscles, bones need exercise to stay strong and healthy. Consult your doctor before you begin any exercise programme.   Eating a balanced diet. Your doctor can advise you  about your diet or whether you should take any dietary supplements.     Are there patients who should not take these tablets?   Yes. Do not take these tablets if:     you have certain disorders of the oesophagus (the tube that connects your mouth with your stomach).     you are unable to stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes.     you are allergic to any of the ingredients.     your doctor has told you that you have low blood calcium.     you are or think you may be pregnant.     you are breast-feeding.     Fosamax should not be given to children.   If you think any of these apply to you, do not take the tablets. Talk to your doctor first and follow his advice .     What else should you know before taking Fosamax?   It is important to tell your doctor before taking Fosamax if:     you suffer from kidney problems.     you have any allergies.     you have any swallowing or digestive problems.       Can you take Fosamax with other medicines?   Fosamax can interact with food, drinks and other medication which you take by mouth, and it is important that you follow the advice given under the heading 'How should you take Fosamax?'   You should always tell your doctor about all drugs you are taking or plan to take, including any obtained without a prescription.     How should you take Fosamax?   It is   very important   that you do the following to help make sure you will benefit from Fosamax:     After getting up for the day, swallow your Fosamax Tablet with a full glass of plain water only (not less than 200 ml or 7 fl oz).       not mineral water.     not coffee or tea     not juice.

By following actions 1, 2 and 3 you will help the Fosamax Tablet reach your stomach quickly and help avoid irritation of your oesophagus (the tube that connects your mouth with your stomach).      After swallowing your Fosamax Tablet, wait at least 30 minutes before taking your first food beverage, or other medication of the day including antacids, calcium supplements and vitamins. Fosamax is effective only if taken when your stomach is empty.     If you develop difficulty or pain upon swallowing, chest pain, or new or worsening heartburn, stop taking Fosamax and contact your doctor.     Take one Fosamax Tablet once a day, every day.     It is important that you continue taking Fosamax for as long as your doctor prescribes the medicine. Fosamax can treat your osteoporosis only if you continue to take the tablets.

Keep the leaflet, you may want to read it again.    WHAT IS IN YOUR MEDICINE?   The name of your medicine is Euglucon 5mg Tablets. Each tablet contains 5mg of the active ingredient, Glibenclamide BP.   The tablets also contain lactose, maize starch, aerosil, talc, magnesium stearate and purified water.   Euglucon is available in blister packs of 28 or 100 tablets.   Glibenclamide, the active ingredient, belongs to a group of medicines called 'oral hypoglycaemic agents'. They act to lower the amount of sugar in your blood.     WHO HAS MADE YOUR MEDICINE?   The marketing authorisation for Euglucon 5mg tablets is held by Roussel Laboratories Ltd, Broadwater Park, Orbital Road, Denham, Uxbridge, Middlesex UB9 5HP. It is manufactured by Roussel Laboratories Ltd, Covingharn   Swindon, Wiltshire SN3 5BZ.     WHY DO YOU NEED TO TAKE YOUR MEDICINE?   Your doctor has diagnosed that you have too much sugar in your blood (or diabetes mellitus). Even though you have kept to a low sugar diet, it is still too high and you need to take the tablets to keep it as low as possible. You must stick to your recommended diet while taking the tablets. Taking the tablets does NOT mean you can ignore the dietary advice given to you.     WILL THE TABLETS SUIT YOU?   Before you take Euglucon tablets, please read the following statements.    Do not take the tablets if;      You have very high blood sugar levels, as happens in uncontrolled diabetics needing insulin     You suffer from certain other illnesses, such as liver, adrenal gland, kidney or thyroid problems     You are pregnant or breastfeeding     You are under the age of 14     You have suffered a severe reaction to these or tablets of a similar type in the past     If you think that any of these apply to you, DO NOT start the tablets - go back and discuss it with your doctor.     ARE YOU TAKING ANY OTHER MEDICINES?   Euglucon and other medicines that you may be taking sometimes affect each other's action. This may result in an increase or a decrease in your sugar levels.    For this reason it is important that you tell your doctor or pharmacist about ALL the medicines that you are taking including those bought without a prescription.    This is especially so if you use pain-killers such as aspirin or any cough or cold remedies or are taking medication; for any of the following conditions:- High blood pressure Asthma Heart problems such as angina High cholesterol levels Anything to suppress (decrease) your appetite Thyroid problems Rheumatism Gout Cancer Depression or any emotional problem To thin your blood and stop it clotting easily (anticoagulants, such as warfarin) Contraception (the pill or mini-pill) Any bacterial infection (antibiotics)   Your doctor may need to change your dose of Euglucon because of your other medicines.     WHAT IF I BECOME ILL (with something other than my diabetes)?   Some other conditions, particularly feverish illnesses such as bronchitis or 'flu, other infections or injury can affect your blood sugar. If you have such an illness consult your doctor, you may need extra treatment.    NOTE:   If you become pregnant, you may need other treatment for your diabetes such as insulin. You may restart Euglucon after the baby is born. Your doctor will advise you about this.     WHAT ABOUT DRIVING OR OPERATING MACHINERY?   A low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia), which may occur from time to time in some patients, may cause light-headedness, a pounding heart, clamminess or sweaty palms. If you experience the symptoms of low blood sugar, you should not drive or operate machinery. Your doctor will give you further advice. If your blood sugar is stabilised, you may drive or operate machinery.    HOW SHOULD YOU TAKE YOUR MEDICINE?    Always take the number of tablets your doctor has asked you to take. At first this will be half a tablet or a single one. This will usually be taken once a day.   If you are changing the type of medicine used to treat your diabetes, your doctor will give you instructions. To start with you may have to take both types together.   Your doctor may increase your dose if the blood sugar level does not come down enough. You should not take more than your doctor tells you.   Euglucon tablets should be taken with or immediately after food. This will usually be with breakfast or the first main meal of the day.     WHAT IF YOU TAKE TOO MANY?   If you take too many tablets by accident, you must take 3-4 sugar lumps dissolved in water to balance the effect of the tablets. You can repeat this if you feel it is necessary after 15 minutes. If you still feel unwell, consult your doctor straight away.     WHAT IF YOU MISS A DOSE?   It is very important that you do not miss a dose. You should try not to miss any tablets, since high blood sugar can cause problems. If you do miss one, take it as soon as possible with food. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and carry on as normal. Do not take an extra tablet to make up.     WHAT ABOUT SIDE EFFECTS?   Like all medicines, Euglucon may cause you some problems. These are rare, and usually minor, for example tummy upsets, slight sickness, decreased appetite (anorexia) or diarrhoea, and usually disappear with time. Your skin may feel itchy and develop a rash.   Sometimes people taking Euglucon may find that they feel more tired and unwell than usual. Others may notice that they bruise or bleed more easily if they cut themselves. Please tell your doctor if you notice any of these effects. Your doctor may want to perform regular blood tests to monitor your medical condition. If this is so, do not worry, it is just routine.   Very rarely, people have become jaundiced (yellowing of the skin) or developed liver problems such as hepatitis during treatment with Euglucon. If you notice this, stop taking the tablets, tell your doctor immediately.   If you have any other problems and think that your medicine may be causing them, tell your doctor or pharmacist.    NOTE:   light-headedness, a pounding heart, clamminess or sweaty palms may mean that your blood sugar is too low and the dose of Euglucon is not right for you. If you think this is happening to you, or you think you are reacting badly in any other way, STOP taking the tablets and contact your doctor or pharmacist straight away.    HOW SHOULD YOU STORE YOUR MEDICINE?    Do not use your medicine after the expiry date shown on the label.   Keep it in the pack in which it was given to you. Do not transfer your medicine to another container.   Keep this medicine in a safe place where children cannot get at it. Your medicines could harm them.

Doctors sometimes prescribe Zyloric-300 for other purposes, but will tell you more if you ask them.    The name of your medicine is Zyloric-300 (allopurinol). It belongs to a group of medicines called enzyme inhibitors, which act, like a water-tap, to control the rate at which special chemical changes occur in the body. It is used to prevent gout and other conditions associated with excess uric acid in the body, including calcium stones in the kidney.

Are you taking or likely to be taking any other medicines whilst you are taking Zyloric-300?     Have you previously experienced an allergic reaction to allopurinol?     If you are about to start taking Zyloric-300 for gout for the very first time, are you experiencing an attack of gout at the present?     Do you suffer from any liver or kidney disease?     Are you pregnant or trying to become pregnant?     If the answer is YES to any of these questions or you are not sure, tell your doctor or pharmacist.         Taking your medicine         It is important to take your medicine every day. The label on the carton should tell you how many tablets to take and how often. If it doesn't or you are not sure, ask your doctor or pharmacist.     The usual dosage for adults is one Zyloric-300mg tablet, each day. Try to take your tablet at the same time each day. It helps you to remember if you do this as part of your daily routine, for example, at breakfast time.     The back of the tablet blister strip is marked in days of the week. Press your first tablet out through the foil marked with today's day - for instance, if today is Tuesday, use one marked 'Tue', move onto the 'Wed' tablet tomorrow, and so on. This will help you to check that you have taken each tablet on the correct day. Follow the arrows, and do not start another blister strip of tablets until the first is finished. You should then start a new blister strip (on the same day you started the first one) every two weeks.          The tablet should be swallowed with half a teacup of water, after a meal (not on an empty stomach).         If you forget to take a tablet, take it as soon as you remember. Then go on as before. The calendar markings should help you to check that you are taking your tablets correctly.     Do not stop taking your Zyloric-300 simply because you feel better, as your condition may get worse     In the event of accidental overdose, contact your doctor immediately.         †After taking your medicine       This medicine may cause side-effects in some people, although these are rare.

What's in your medicine     Zyloric-300 tablets are creamy white and contain 300mg of allopurinol. The word 'Zyloric-300' appears on each tablet.     They do not contain any colourants or preservatives.       About Gout   Gout is caused by having high levels of uric acid in the blood. If too much uric acid is present in the blood, some of it can form into needle-like crystals - often in the joints. Your body tries to fight these, which causes pain and swelling.   Zyloric-300 works by controlling the amount of uric acid in your blood, stopping the crystals from forming, and so avoids the pain and swelling. If you stop taking the tablets, control is lost, so you would once again be likely to get an attack.   It is not unusual for the number of gouty attacks to increase until your uric acid level becomes stable as it may take a while for Zyloric-300 to achieve full control. Your doctor may prescribe extra medicines to help until the uric acid level is reduced.    Gout affects all sorts of people. Mostly it seems to be an hereditary illness, though diet may also be partly responsible in some cases. Your doctor may suggest that you try to avoid certain foods (kidneys, liver, sardines, turkey, shellfish) and excess alcohol. You may be asked to drink plenty of water, avoid the cold and not over-eat. If you follow your doctor's advice and take your Zyloric-300 tablet daily, you should get no further attacks of gout.    REMEMBER: This medicine is for YOU Only a doctor can prescribe it for you. Never give it to others. It may harm them even if their symptoms are the same as yours.

WHY DOES YOUR DOCTOR WANT YOU TO TAKE ‘INNOZIDE’?     Your Condition   Your doctor has probably prescribed 'Innozide' because your blood pressure is too high.    Your Treatment   Each 'Innozide' Tablet contains 20 mg of enalapril maleate and 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. The first is one of a group of medicines called 'ACE inhibitors'. They work on the body to reduce raised blood pressure. The second is one of a group sometimes called a 'water-tablet'. For more information, see the back of this leaflet or consult your doctor    WHEN SHOULD YOU TAKE YOUR TABLETS?    You should take the tablet at the same time each day unless your doctor tells you to do otherwise.   Usually, people take them with a drink of water If you have been given a calendar pack, take the tablet marked for that day. This will help you to remember whether you have taken your tablet for that day. If you are confused or unsure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.        KEEP TAKING 'INNOZIDE'   You should continue taking the tablets for as long as your doctor has asked, unless you develop any problems, in which case consult your doctor.      CAN 'INNOZIDE' CAUSE PROBLEMS?   Any treatment can cause problems. Most problems with 'Innozide' are minor and are listed on the back of the leaflet. Your doctor can give you more information .     IS 'INNOZIDE' MEANT FOR YOU?   You should feel satisfied that it is all right for you to take 'Innozide'. Some people—listed on the back of the leaflet—should not take them. Your doctor can give you more information.    HOW SHOULD YOU STORE THE TABLETS  ?   You should keep the tablets well away from children. For more advice about how to look after your tablets, see the back of the leaflet.     THIS IS NOT THE ONLY INFORMATION WE HAVE ABOUT 'INNOZIDE'. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AFTER YOU HAVE READ THIS LEAFLET, ASK YOUR DOCTOR OR PHARMACIST, WHO WILL GIVE YOU MORE INFORMATION.        MORE ABOUT 'INNOZIDE’ MAKE SURE 'INNOZIDE' IS MEANT FOR YOU   You should only take the tablets if your doctor has asked you and in the way he has told you. Some people, however, should not use them.

You are breast feeding.     You have suffered from itching, nettle rash, wheezing or swelling of the mouth or eyelids as a reaction to this or similar medicines in the past.

Your doctor will know about these and will change your treatment if necessary.   You should stop your treatment if you have severe dizziness, lightheadedness or headaches, or if you begin to itch, get short of breath, or develop swelling of the hands, face or eyes. If this happens, or you think you ale reacting badly in any other way, stop your treatment and see your doctor.     DOES 'INNOZIDE' MIX WITH     OTHER MEDICINES?   There are some other medicines — such as some others used to treat high blood pressure or heart failure — which affect the way 'Innozide"" works.   Your doctor knows about these, and will alter your treatment. Usually it does not matter if you are taking some other medicines, but you must tell your doctor which they are — even those bought without a doctor's prescription.     HOW MUCH SHOULD YOU TAKE?    You should take the tablets as your doctor has asked. The dose will depend on your condition, and whether you are taking other treatment. The first dose is one tablet, which may need to be increased to two tablets to have the best effect. You should not take more than you have been prescribed. The maximum daily dose is two tablets.     WHAT IF YOU FORGET A TABLET?   Do not worry if you miss one, just carry on with the next dose as normal. Don't take an extra one to make up. If you take too many tablets by accident, contact your doctor immediately.    WHAT ABOUT ALCOHOL?    'Innozide' and alcohol interfere with each other to cause dizziness or lightheadedness.

The symptoms of migraine may be due to swollen blood vessels around the brain. Medicines like Imigran probably work by reducing the size of these blood vessels and are called 5HT1, receptor agonists.      IF YOU ARE NOT SURE WHY THEY HAVE BEEN PRESCRIBED FOR YOU ASK YOUR DOCTOR      Before taking your tablets      If you are allergic to Imigran or sumatriptan or any of the ingredients, or     If you suffer from unexpected shortness of breath, or from pain or tightness in the chest (which may or may not spread to your jaw or upper arms)? or       If you have any of the following medical conditions:     heart disease such as – heart failure, angina or coronary thrombosis (heart attack) high blood pressure disease of the liver or kidneys or     If you are taking any medicines for your migraine which contain ergotamine, (If so, you should stop taking them at least 24 hours before taking Imigran-50 tablets), or     If you are taking any medicines on a doctor's prescription for the treatment of depression or to help you lose weight, or     If you are pregnant, or likely to become pregnant, or breast feeding, or     If you are over 65 years of age, or     If you have a family history of heart disease.

Swallow each tablet whole with a little water. Do not chew or crush them.

What to do if you take too many tablets   It is important to keep to the dose on the label. Taking more than this could make you ill. If an overdose is taken,   DO NOT DELAY  , ask your doctor what to do or contact your nearest hospital emergency department.

It is important that you inhale each dose as instructed by your doctor. The label will usually tell you what dose to take and how often. If it doesn't or you are not sure, ask your doctor or pharmacist.      DOSE    Usually   the most   you would take in a 24 hour period is:    AduIts–16 puffs    Children–8 puffs.     BUT YOU MUST NOT   inhale more doses or use your inhaler more often than your doctor advises.     It takes a few days for this medicine to work and it is   VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU USE IT REGULARLY.  DO NOT STOP   treatment even if you feel better unless told to do so by your doctor.      DO NOT USE THIS MEDICINE TO TREAT A SUDDEN ATTACK OF BREATHLESSNESS    – it will not help you . You will probably need a different kind of medicine in a different colour pack which your doctor may already have given you.  If you have more than one medicine be careful not to confuse them.      IF  YOU MISS A DOSE     If you miss a dose   DO NOT   WORRY – just take the next dose when it is due.       IF YOU TAKE  TOO MUCH     Tell your doctor as soon as possible if you accidentally take a larger dose than you were recommended.       HOW TO USE YOUR INHALER      1    Remove the mouthpiece cover and check the mouthpiece inside and outside to see that it is clean   .         TESTING YOUR INHALER   If you have not used your inhaler for a week or more release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.      2  Shake the inhaler well          Hold the inhaler upright as shown above with your thumb on the base, below the mouthpiece.  Breathe out as far as is comfortable and then..    Place the mouthpiece in your mouth between your teeth and close your lips firmly around it   but do not bite it.        Just atter starting to breathe in   through your mouth   press down on the top of the inhaler to release Becotide while still breathing in   steadily and deeply.         Hold your breath, take the inhaler from your mouth and your finger from the top of the inhaler.  Continue holding your breath for as long as is comfortable.     If you are to take a second puff   keep the inhaler upright   and wait about half a minute before repeating steps 2 to 6.     After use always replace the mouthpiece cover to keep out dust and fluff.      IMPORTANT    Do not rush Stages 3, 4 and 5.    It is important that you start to breath in as   slowly   as possible just before operating your inhaler.  Practice in front of a mirror for the first few times.  If you see “mist” coming from the top of the inhaler or the sides of your mouth you should start again from Stage 2.     If your doctor has given you different instructions for using your inhaler, please follow them carefully.  Tell your doctor if you have any difficulties.      CHILDREN    Young children may need help and their parents may need to operate the inhaler for them.  Encourage the child to breathe out and operate the inhaler just after the child starts to breathe in (see picture 5).  Practice the technique together.     CLEANING    Your inhaler should be cleaned at least once a week.      Pull the metal canister out of the plastic body of the inhaler and remove the mouthpiece cover.      Rinse the plastic body and the mouthpiece cover in warm water.      Leave to dry in a warm place.  Avoid excessive heat.      Replace the canister and mouthpiece cover.      A mild detergent or a solution of the type used to clean babies feeding bottles may be added to the water (your pharmacist will advise you).     Then rinse thoroughly with clean water before drying.    Do not put the metal canister into water.

Oestrogens are produced in the ovaries They cause sexual development in women and control the menstrual cycle during the childbearing years.   When women get older the ovaries gradually produce less oestrogen This happens at the menopause (usually around the age of 50).   If the ovaries are removed surgically (ovariectomy} before the menopause, oestrogen production stops very suddenly.   Shortage of oestrogens may lead to complaints such as vaginal infections and recurrent cystitis.   These complaints can be relieved by taking medicines containing oestrogen. However it may take several days or weeks before you notice an improvement.   Unlike most oestrogens, oestriol has little effect on the inner lining of the womb. So Ovestin Tablets usually do not cause vaginal bleeding.      THINGS TO REMEMBER ABOUT MEDICINES     This medicine has been prescribed for your current medical problems. Do not take it for other medical problems.     Do not allow other people to take your medicines and do not take medicines meant for other people.     Tell any doctor treating you what medicines you are taking. Always carry a medical information card stating which medicines you are taking. This can also be very important in case you are involved in an accident.     Return unused medicines to the pharmacy for disposal.

ADMINISTRATION OF YOUR MEDICINE   Q.HOW IS BiCNU GIVEN AND WHAT IS THE USUAL DOSE?   A.BiCNU is injected into a vein over a one to two hour period.  The dose of BiCNU that you received will be calculated according to your size. The usual dose is 200 mg/m2 body surface area every six weeks.  This may be given as a single dose or it can be divided into daily injections of 100 mg/m2 body surface area on two successive days.   Q.HOW OFTEN IS BiCNU GIVEN?   A.BiCNU can usually be given at 6 week intervals. This may vary depending on the results of regular blood tests.   Q.WILL YOU NEED TO HAVE ANY OTHER MEDICINES?

UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS   Q.ARE THERE ANY UNWANTED EFFECTS OF BiCNU?   A.All medicines may cause some unwanted or ""side"" effects.  BiCNU can lower the number of white blood cells found in the body, which may temporarily increase your chance of getting an infection, and it may also lower the number of blood platelets which are necessary for proper blood clotting.  These effects usually occur four to six weeks after a dose of BiCNU.  BiCNU may also lower your number of red blood cells.    If you think you are getting an infection (fever, chills) or you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising (including blood in the urine or black tarry stools) tell your doctor immediately.   BiCNU can also damage your kidneys, although this tends to be more common in patients who have received a large amount over a long period.   Check with your doctor or nurse as soon as possible if you experience any of the following side effects:   Problem with your lungs (shortness of breath or cough), yellowing of the skin or eyes.   Blurring or worsening of vision, or pain in your eyes.   Nausea and vomiting may occur within two hours of receiving BiCNU.  This usually lasts no longer than 4-6 hours.  If this occurs tell your doctor as he/she may give you an anti-nauseant next time you receive BiCNU to help prevent this happening again.   Intense flushing of the skin and eyes has occasionally been reported within two hours of administration. A burning sensation at the site of the injection may also occur.   If you notice any other effects during or after treatment has finished tell your doctor.     LOOKING AFTER YOUR MEDICINE   This medicine will be stored in the refrigerator of the pharmacy and made up in a special area before the doctor or nurse gives it to you.

"    Evorel Oestradiol Patch    The Evorel leaflet is in the form of a small booklet. The information that it contains is reproduced below.     Why should you read this booklet?   Please read this booklet carefully, it contains important information about Evorel patches and tells you what you should know to be able to use them correctly. This booklet answers some common questions regarding the use of Evorel patches (but does not contain the complete information). If you have any questions about what is written here, or wish for any further information, please ask your doctor or pharmacist.   The book contains general information about the menopause and why Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT), such as Evorel is useful.     What is in Evorel patches?   Evorel patches contain a natural oestrogen called oestradiol. The patches come in 4 different sizes: Evorel 25, Evorel 50, Evorel 75 and Evorel 100. The patches contain 1.6 mg, 3.2 mg, 4.8 mg, 6.4 mg of oestradiol and deliver 25, 50, 75 and 100 mcg of oestradiol respectively per 24 hours.   Evorel patches also contain other ingredients as follows: Duro-Tak 280-2287, Guar Gum; Hostaphan MN19.     What should Evorel patches look like?   Evorel patches are square shaped, transparent patches with a self-adhesive backing which can be stuck to the skin.   Evorel 25 is marked CE25 and has a surface area of 8 sq cm.   Evorel 50 is marked CE50 and has a surface area of 16 sq cm.   Evorel 75 is marked CE75 and has a surface area of 24 sq cm.   Evorel 100 is marked CE100 and has a surface area of 32 sq cm.   In each patch the oestradiol is spread evenly in the adhesive and this passes slowly through the skin into the body.   Evorel patches come in a memory pack containing 8 patches.     What type of medicine is an Evorel patch?   An Evorel patch is a hormone replacement therapy (HRT).    Product licence holder:   Janssen-Cilag Ltd, Saunderton, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire HP14 4HJ.    Manufactured by:   LTS Lohmann GmbH & Co KG Lohmannstrasse 2, D-56626 Andernach, Germany.     What are Evorel patches used for?   Evorel patches are used for hormone replacement therapy in the treatment of symptoms of the menopause. These may be caused by a lack of naturally occurring oestrogens and progestogens.     What is the menopause?   Women produce oestrogen hormones from their ovaries throughout their adult life. These hormones have many effects, e.g., sexual development and control of the menstrual cycle.   The menopause occurs when a woman's ovaries cease to function and there is a decline in the levels of hormones produced by the ovaries, one of these being oestrogen. This is a gradual process which takes place over a number of years - a time known as the 'change of life'. During this time oestrogen levels fluctuate and decline and it is this which causes symptoms such as hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings and local vaginal symptoms such as dryness and itching and uncomfortable or painful intercourse. Low oestrogen levels also result from surgical removal of the ovaries - this may be done at the same time as a hysterectomy (womb removal). This is described as a surgical menopause and may cause the same symptoms as given above.     How do Evorel patches work?   The Evorel patch replaces the natural oestrogen that is normally released by the ovaries. It does this by passing the oestrogen from the patch into the body through the skin. The active levels of oestrogen in the body are reached about 4 hours after the patch is applied to the skin and last for 3 to 4 days after which the patch must be changed.     Are Evorel patches safe for you?   Do not use Evorel patches if you are pregnant or think that you might be pregnant; if you are breast feeding.   Do not use Evorel patches if you have, or have ever had cancer of the breast or womb, or other cancers known to be sensitive to oestrogens.   Do not use Evorel patches if you have any of the following: severe liver, kidney or heart disease, blood clots (thrombosis); inflammation of veins, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding; endometriosis; hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in Evorel patches; Rotor Syndrome or Dubin-Johnson Syndrome.   If you have any of the following you may still be able to use Evorel patches but you should discuss this with your doctor first. He/she may need to see you more regularly whilst you are using Evorel. History of: thrombosis, blood clots, stroke, heart attack. Epilepsy diabetes, high blood pressure, certain liver problems which may cause jaundice, any problems with your breasts or a family history of breast cancer, uterine fibroids, gallstones, otosclerosis (bone formation in the ear), multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; Lupus), porphyria, melanoma, migraine, asthma, as these conditions may be worsened by oestrogen HRT.   If you are not sure about any of the conditions mentioned above please consult your doctor.     Special warnings   It is important that you have a full and thorough physical and gynaecological examination and that your own and family's medical histories are taken before you start any Hormone Replacement Therapy.   There is some evidence that HRT may increase the risk of breast cancer in post menopausal women. If you have taken HRT for 5 years you should discuss with your doctor whether you should receive further HRT treatment.   If you still have your womb (i.e., have not had a hysterectomy) taking oestrogen alone may increase the risk of overgrowth of the womb lining. You should discuss this with your doctor who may prescribe another hormone progestogen to take with the oestrogen.   You should receive regular full medical examinations whilst taking Evorel.   If you have had a blood clot in the leg or lung, a stroke or a heart attack or are immobile for any reason, such as after an operation, you may still be able to use Evorel patches but your doctor should decide this and check you regularly if you do use it. If this occurs while using Evorel, treatment should be stopped and your doctor contacted immediately.   Evorel patches should not be used by children.   Evorel patches should not be used for contraception .     Are you taking other medicine?   Some medicines can alter the way Evorel works, such as barbiturates, hydantoins, carbamazepine, meprobamate, phenylbutazone and rifampicin. If you are taking any of these medicines consult your doctor.     How should you use Evorel patches?   Evorel patches are available in 4 different sizes: Evorel 25, Evorel 50, Evorel 75 and Evorel 100. These contain different amounts of the oestrogen hormone oestradiol. Your doctor will choose which size is suitable for you to use.   The following instructions apply to all 4 sizes of Evorel patches:    When to use the patch   There is enough hormone in each patch to last for several days but to ensure a steady supply to the body, the patches must be changed at 3 or 4 day intervals. To make it easy to remember when this should be done, keep to the same two days every week. This will mean that one patch is on for three and the other for four days. For example, if you use your first patch on a Monday, it should be changed on Thursday and again on the following Monday.   You can work out your two days from the following table, starting from the first day of use:      If you put your fist patch on   Change on  Change again on   Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday  Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday  Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday   To help you remember your ""two patch change"" days, mark them as shown:     Mon  Tue  Wed  Thu  Fri  Sat  Sun   Thu  Fri  Sat  Sun  Mon  Tue  Wed     How to put the patch on   The patch should be applied to clean, dry skin but not on top of cuts, spots or other skin blemishes OR on an area where you have just applied cream, moisturiser or talc.   The Evorel Patch should be applied to the skin as soon as it is removed from the wrapper and applied as described below.     Tear open the wrapper, first between the 'V's along one edge and then along the other edge. Take out the patch.     With the silver foil facing you, bend the patch and peel off one half of the foil.   Do not touch the sticky side of the patch   otherwise it may not stick properly.     Apply the open half of the patch to your skin, remove the other half of the foil and press down the rest of the patch.     Press the patch with the palm of your hand to ensure it is firmly stuck to the skin.     To remove, peel away an edge of the patch and pull smoothly away from the skin.     You may use baby oil to help remove any gum/glue which may remain on your skin after patch removal.        Where to place the Evorel patch   Most women prefer to wear the patch on the thigh or bottom.   It should NEVER be worn on or near the breasts  . Although it can be worn underneath clothing, it should not be placed under elasticated waistbands.   The patch should not be placed on the same area of skin twice in a row.     What if the patch falls off?   Just apply a new patch and keep to your original 'patch change' days. If you have just had a bath or shower, wait until your skin cools before applying a new patch.     What if I forget to change the patch?   Just change it as soon as possible and then keep to your original 'patch change' days.     What do you do in the case of an overdosage?   Overdosage with a patch is unlikely. Effects of too much oestrogen can be reversed simply by removal of the patch. Your doctor may decide to change you to a different size of Evorel patch. The most common symptoms of oestrogen overdose are breast tenderness, nausea and irregular bleeding.     What side effects might Evorel patches cause?   As with any other medicines, in a few women, Evorel patches may cause some unwanted effects. Most are usually minor and will disappear within a couple of months, for example:     Headaches     Local skin irritation     Nausea     Tender breasts     Irregular vaginal bleeding     Rarely, dizziness, bloating, fluid retention, weight gain and leg cramps may occur.   If such side effects are prolonged, or if you react to the patch itself with skin rashes or irritation, remove the patch and ask your doctor for advice. If you notice any other symptoms not listed above whilst using the patch, please tell your doctor about them.     How should you store Evorel patches?   Evorel patches should be stored at room temperature (not exceeding 25ºC). Keep out of reach of children.     Other important points   Do not use this medicine:     After the expiry date shown on the label.     If the pouch is open.       Answers to some common questions about the patch     Can I wash, bathe or shower as normal?   YES, but do not scrub too hard in case you loosen the edges of the patch.     Can I go swimming with the patch on?   YES, the patch will not be affected.     Can I exercise or play sports?   YES, try to avoid wearing it under tight clothing or waistband.     Can I sunbathe with the patch on?   YES, but keep the patch covered to avoid direct sunlight.     What if I am allergic to the patch?   As with normal sticking plaster, allergic reactions to the patch are unlikely. However, should you have such a reaction, please consult your doctor.     Does the patch work as a contraceptive?   NO, the levels of hormone supplied by the Evorel patch are too low for it to do this.

This means that your heart is not working as well as it used to, in order to pump blood around your body, leading to tiredness after light exercise, breathlessness and swelling of your ankles and legs.     ‘Innovace’ may prevent heart failure from getting worse in some patients who have symptoms. These patients may be less likely to go into hospital for treatment of heart failure.   In many patients with early stage heart failure who have no symptoms, including those who have had a heart attack, ‘Innovace’ may help prevent your heart from weakening further (that is, to help prevent you from developing heart failure).   ‘Innovace’ may slow down the development of the signs of heart failure such as tiredness after light exercise, breathlessness and swelling of your ankles and feet Such patients may be less likely to have to go into hospital for treatment for heart failure By taking ‘Innovace’, some heart-failure patients (with or without symptoms) may lessen their risk of heart attack    ARE THERE PATIENTS WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE THESE TABLETS?    Yes, do not take the tablets if:     You are or think you may be pregnant     You are planning to become pregnant       You are breast-feeding      You have suffered from a reaction to ‘Innovace’ or similar medicines in the past or to any of the ingredients and have experienced symptoms such as itching, nettle rash, wheezing or swelling of the hands, throat, mouth or eyelids.     You have a condition called ‘aortic stenosis’ or ‘outflow obstruction’.     If you think any of these apply to you do not take the tablets. Talk to your doctor first and follow his advice.    WHAT ELSE SHOULD YOU KNOW BEFORE TAKING YOUR TABLETS?    If you have kidney disease or are a dialysis patient, check with your doctor before taking ‘Innovace’. In addition you should tell your doctor if you suffer from excessive vomiting or diarrhoea.   In addition to measuring your blood pressure your doctor may wish to test that your kidneys are working properly before you start taking the tablets and at intervals during your treatment.   If you undergo any surgery or receive anaesthetics (even at the dentist) you should make the doctor or dentist treating you aware that you are taking ‘Innovace’.   It is important to tell your doctor if you suffer from lactose intolerance. Lactose is one of the inactive ingredients in ‘Innovace’ Tablets.     CAN YOU TAKE 'INNOVACE' WITH OTHER MEDICINES?   It is important that you tell your doctor about all of the medicines you are taking particularly others used to treat high blood pressure or heart failure (for example beta-blockers, methyldopa, calcium antagonists, diuretics   (water tablets). and adrenergic blocking drugs such as guanethidine), and a drug called lithium. Also, tell your doctor if you are on a salt-restricted diet, are taking potassium supplements, potassium-sparing agents or potassium-containing salt substitutes. Your doctor knows about these and will alter your treatment as needed. Tell your doctor about any medicines you are taking that you obtained without a prescription.     HOW SHOULD YOU TAKE     'INNOVACE'?   You must keep taking ‘Innovace’ as your doctor has told you. The dose you take will depend on your condition and whether you are taking any other treatment.   The usual dosages are as follows:   High blood pressure: Treatment is usually started with 5 mg once a day, and increased gradually up to 10-20 mg once daily. The maximum dose is 40 mg a day.

You should take your tablet at the same time each day unless your doctor tells you otherwise. If you are taking 2 tablets a day, take one in the morning and one in the evening unless your doctor has told you otherwise.

What is in your cream   Cutivate Cream is one of a group of medicines called topical steroids. ""Topical"" means they are put on the skin. Topical steroids reduce the redness and itchiness of certain skin problems. (They should not be confused with ""anabolic"" steroids misused by some body builders and taken as tablets or injections).   The cream contains:   The active ingredient - fluticasone (as propionate) 0.05% a preservative - imidurea in a base containing liquid paraffin, cetostearyl alcohol, isopropyl myristate, cetomacrogol 1000, propylene glycol, sodium phosphate, citric acid and water.   The cream does not contain any lanolin, parabens or colouring agents.      Product licence holder and manufacturer   Product Licence held by Glaxo Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, Stockley Park, England UB11 1BT Manufactured by Glaxo Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, Speke, Liverpool, England      Before you use your cream      This cream has been prescribed to treat the skin problem that you showed to your doctor.   DO NOT put it on any other skin problems as it could make them worse, especially:   acne skin infections such as cold sores, herpes, impetigo, athletes foot, chicken pox, ringworm, thrush itchiness of anus (back passage) itchiness of genitals (private parts) conditions called rosacea and perioral dermatitis.   If you have had an allergy to any creams or ointments in the past If you think you may be pregnant   Did you tell your doctor at the last visit or an earlier visit?   IF YOU DID   NOT   TELL YOUR DOCTOR THEN YOU SHOULD DO SO   BEFORE   STARTING THE TREATMENT.   Even so, your doctor may still want you to use the cream.    Face   YOU SHOULD NOT normally use on the face where the skin thins easily - BUT if your doctor has advised you to use it on the face then, if possible, the course of treatment should not last more than five days. It is important that you DO NOT let the cream get in your eyes.     Children   DO NOT use on a child under one year of age, or under the napkin, or airtight dressing of an infant older than one year. (These make it easier for the active ingredient to pass through the skin).      How to use your cream   If your doctor has told you in detail HOW MUCH to use and HOW OFTEN then keep to this advice. If you are not sure then follow the advice on the back of this leaflet.    Unless told by your doctor:      YOU SHOULD NOT   use more than this.      YOU SHOULD NOT   use on large areas of the body for a long time (such as nearly everyday for many weeks or months).     Overuse like this may:     thin the skin so that it damages easily     allow the active ingredient to pass through the skin and affect other parts of the body, especially in infants and children.     If your skin problem does not improve in two to four weeks tell your doctor.  continued       Has the cream any side effects?      Most people find using this cream causes no problems when used in the right amount for the correct length of time (See above as well as guidance on back of this leaflet).    IF   you find your condition gets worse during treatment you may be allergic to the cream or have a skin infection.     STOP USING THE CREAM AND TELL YOUR DOCTOR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE   Repeated courses of topical steroids over a long period of time may sometimes cause changes in hair growth and skin colour.      Guidance on how much cream to use If your doctor has told you in detail how to use the cream then keep to that advice otherwise:-   Once a day, after washing your hands, gently rub the correct amount of cream into the skin until it has all disappeared.    For an adult:   You should find that two fingertips of cream will treat both hands or one foot three fingertips of cream will treat one arm six fingertips of cream will treat one leg fourteen fingertips of cream will treat the front and back of one trunk    Fingertip Units               Do not worry if you find you need a little more or a little less than this - it is only a rough guide.   Wash your hands before using the cream. Gently rub the correct amount into the skin until it has all disappeared.   Unless   used for treating the hands wash them again   after   using the cream. Anyone who helps to rub in the cream should also do the same or wear disposable plastic gloves.      For a child:   It should not be used in children under one year of age.   The smaller the child the less you use.   A child of 4 years needs about a third of the adult amount.   A course of treatment for a child should not normally last more than five days unless your doctor has told you to use it for longer.      Where to keep your cream   As with all medicines keep this cream safely away from children.      Store it at room temperature below 30ºC    What to do with any unused cream   If your doctor stops your treatment, return any unused cream to a pharmacist.

Please read it before using your Canesten Duopak CANESTEN 100MG PESSARY CANESTEN 1% CREAM   WHAT DO CANESTEN 100MG PESSARIES AND CANESTEN 1% CREAM CONTAIN?

The pessaries come in a box of six and the cream comes in tubes of 20g and 50 g.   Canesten 100 mg  Pessaries and 1% cream contain clotrimazole.   This is one of a group of medicines called imidazoles which are used  to treat fungal infections such as thrush.    Product Licence holder:   Bayer plc Pharmaceuticals Division Bayer House, Strawberry Hill Newbury, Berkshire, RG14 1JA Manufacturer: Bayer AG Leverkusen, Germany     WHEN SHOULD I USE CANESTEN 100MG   PESSARIES?   The pessaries should be used to treat vaginal thrush .   Vaginal thrush (candidiasis) is a common infection caused by a fungus which may live harmlessly in the vagina without you even noticing it.  However, in certain circumstances it may develop into an infection in the vagina and the symptoms may spread to the surrounding area (the vulva).   The common symptoms of thrush are:     itching of the vagina and vulva     redness and swelling of the tissues of the vagina and vulva     soreness of the vagina     a white non-smelling discharge from the vagina     Not everybody who has thrush has all of these symptoms.  You may have only one of them.   If this is the first time you have had these symptoms, talk to your doctor before using any treatment.     WHEN SHOULD I USE CANESTEN 1%   CREAM?   The cream should be used to soothe and relieve the irritation of the vulva (vulvitis) which is caused by thrush.   It can also be used for the treatment of irritation of the end of the penis (glans) which is caused by thrush.  If the cream is used to treat your sexual partner at the same time as your own treatment, it can help prevent re-infection and so reduce the frequency of your attacks of thrush.   Canesten 1% cream can also be used to treat fungal skin infections such as ringworm, athlete’s foot, fungal nappy rash and fungal infection of the breast fold (intertrigo).   WHEN SHOULD I NOT USE CANESTEN 100mg PESSARIES AND CANESTEN 1% CREAM?   Do not use the pessaries or cream if you have previously had an allergic reaction to the active ingredient clotrimazole.  If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor or pharmacist.   See your doctor as soon as possible and   do not   use the pessaries if you have any of the following symptoms:     irregular vaginal bleeding     abnormal vaginal bleeding or a blood-stained discharge     ulcers, blisters, sores or pain of the vagina or vulva      lower abdominal pain     pain or difficulty in passing urine     fever or chills     feeling sick or vomiting     diarrhoea     a foul smelling discharge from the vagina     This is because Canesten 100mg Pessaries may not be the right treatment for you.    If you are unsure whether you have thrush, check with your doctor before using Canesten Duopak.      WHAT SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS SHOULD I   TAKE?   If you are pregnant or are planning a family, tell your doctor or pharmacist before using Canesten Duopak.  If you have informed your doctor or pharmacist already, follow their instructions carefully.   During pregnancy, extra care should be taken when using the applicator.   Before using the pessaries, you should see your doctor if:     you have had more than two infections in the last six months     you or your partner have ever had a sexually transmitted disease     you are aged under 16 or over 60 years     you have ever had an allergic reaction to Canesten or any other anti-fungal products.     WHEN AND HOW DO I USE CANESTEN DUOPAK?   The carton contains six Canesten 100mg Pessaries held inside a foil blister pack, an applicator for insertion of the pessaries into the vagina and a tube of Canesten 1% cream.  This is a full course of treatment.  However, in the event that your symptoms persist upon completion of the course, see your doctor as he/she may recommend further treatment.   If Canesten Duopak has been prescribed for you by your doctor, follow any instructions he/she may have given you.  If you have purchased this product without a prescription, follow these directions closely:     CANESTEN 100MG PESSARIES   The applicator should be used to insert a pessary into the vagina before going to sleep on six consecutive nights. Alternatively, two pessaries may be inserted into the vagina before going to sleep on three consecutive nights.     00505450/5202/UK/1/965/og   Please follow the instructions below carefully:       Remove the applicator from the packaging.  Pull out plunger A until it stops.  Remove a pessary from the blister pack and place the pessary firmly into applicator B (Diagram 1).  To fit the pessary into the applicator, the holder of the applicator needs to be squeezed lightly at either side.  The pessary fits tightly into   the applicator and needs to be squeezed into the holder just far enough to be held in place during insertion (about 1cm).     When you remember, continue with your course of treatment.  If you have forgotten for more than one day, your infection may not be fully treated, so if symptoms persist upon completion of this course, please arrange to see your doctor   If you forget to use the cream, apply it as soon as possible and then continue the rest of your treatment as usual.   WHAT SIDE-EFFECTS MAY I EXPERIENCE?   Rarely, Canesten 100 mg Pessaries  may cause side-effects in some people.  The side-effects are very similar to the symptoms of thrush.  If the redness, burning, irritation or swelling get worse, stop using the pessaries and see your doctor as soon as possible.    As with all medicines, some people may be allergic to the Canesten Pessaries.  Usually, if you are allergic to the pessaries, a reaction will occur soon after you start using it.  An allergic reaction may appear as a rash, nausea,  faintness or facial swelling.  If you experience any of these effects, tell your doctor Immediately.   Canesten cream may also cause side-effects in some people.  You may experience a mild burning or irritation immediately after applying the cream.  If you find this intolerable, stop treatment and tell your doctor.   If, upon first use of Canesten cream you experience a rash and itching, tell your doctor immediately as you may be allergic to it.   If symptoms get worse or persist or you feel you are reacting badly to this medicine in any other way, speak to your doctor or pharmacist.   HOW SHOULD I STORE MY CANESTEN DUOPAK?

IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT 'HALFAN'     You should consult your doctor before taking 'Halfan' if you (or any member of your family) have heart problems or if you have taken tablets for your heart, or if you suffer from blackouts or if you are taking any other tablets from a doctor or pharmacist (chemist).     If you think you may have salt depletion as a result of prolonged severe diarrhoea and vomiting (being sick) or usage of diuretics (water tablets) consult your doctor before taking 'Halfan'.     If you are taking the antimalarial mefloquine (Lariam) or have taken it within the last 3 months or if you are taking any other antimalarials, you must inform your doctor before taking 'Halfan'.     You should not take this medicine if you think or have been told that you are allergic to 'Halfan'. If so tell your doctor, you may be given another medicine instead.     Before taking ANY medicines you should tell you doctor if you are pregnant (or think you may be), or if you are breast feeding.     Like all medicines, 'Halfan' can sometimes cause unwanted effects. [You will find more about this later in this leaflet.)     ALWAYS KEEP MEDICINES OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN     For more information on 'Halfan' and malaria, please read the rest of this leaflet.     BEFORE TAKING YOUR MEDICINE     What should I do it I think I am pregnant (or I am breast feeding)?   Do not take 'Halfan' without consulting your doctor. You may be given another medicine instead.     TAKING YOUR MEDICINE   How much should I take and how often?    'HALFAN' SHOULD BE TAKEN ON AN EMPTY STOMACH.    Follow your doctor's directions about how and when to take your medicine. Please read the dispensing label carefully, it will tell you how many 'Halfan' tablets to take for each dose. DO NOT TAKE MORE THAN THE DOSE YOUR DOCTOR HAS RECOMMENDED. Your pharmacist or doctor can help if you are not sure.    The tablets should be swallowed with water   For the first 24 hours of treatment (day one), there are three doses of 'Halfan' to be taken. You must take the first dose immediately, the second dose six hours later and the last dose six hours after that. All doses should be taken on an empty stomach. For example:    The normal adult dose is two tablets three times a day. Children weighing less than 37 kg will be given less than this according to their weight.   Your doctor may also instruct you to take a second course of treatment one week later on day eight. This course will also be three doses taken six hours apart.   It is important to follow your doctor's instructions. Your symptoms may come back if you stop your treatment too early.      What should I do if I forget to take a dose?   It is   very important   that 'Halfan' doses are taken exactly as instructed. However, if you forget to take a dose at the right time, take it as soon as you remember, but then take the next dose six hours later.     AFTER TAKING YOUR MEDICINE     What unwanted effects might it have?   A few people may find that 'Halfan' gives them diarrhoea, stomach pains, sickness, itching or a rash. If this happens, these symptoms are usually mild. If you suffer badly tell your doctor immediately.   In some patients 'Halfan' could cause serious heart or blood problems. If you develop any unusual problems such as fainting, blackouts, palpitations, irregular heart beats, fits or brown-coloured urine, tell your doctor immediately.   If your doctor decides to stop treatment, return any left-over medicine to your pharmacist.     What if I have taken too much?   If more than the recommended dose has been taken, consult your doctor or local hospital casualty department at once.    Following its stay in the liver, the parasite enters another stage of its life cycle by being released into the bloodstream. Here it penetrates red blood cells multiplies and causes the blood cells to burst, releasing large numbers of parasites. each able to infect a new red blood cell. The release of these parasites coincides with the malaria fever It takes two to three days for newly infected blood cells to release further parasites and this explains the well-known intermittent character of the fever. In some cases. the infection is so severe that the fever is continuous.       What are the symptoms of malaria?   The incubation period following the bite of a mosquito bearing the infection is at least five to 10 days - but longer than a year may elapse before the symptoms appear. The principal symptoms are a continuous or intermittent fever with malaise, shivering, headache, tiredness, mental confusion. dizziness or muscle pains. Gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, loss of appetite or diarrhoea may also be present. Serious cases may involve jaundice, convulsions or coma.    Malaria should always be suspected in any person who has a fever or other worrying symptoms and has recently travelled to a malarial area. YOU MUST CONSULT A DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY.      What steps should be taken BEFORE you travel to a malarial region?   You should always consult your doctor in advance of any travel to or through a malarial region - no matter how often you may have visited the country before. Preventative drugs can be prescribed; these drugs suppress the red blood cell forms of the parasite. They generally must be started one to two weeks before entering a malarial region (to ensure a sufficient blood level of the drug before any possible exposure to malaria). They are taken continuously during the visit and continued for four to eight weeks afterwards. It is important that any preventative drugs are taken exactly as prescribed, for the full course.   NOTE: 'HALFAN' IS NOT A PREVENTATIVE DRUG.   It is also vital that you receive the correct drug for the region to which you are travelling. In many parts of the world, the malaria parasite has become resistant to several of these preventative drugs.   No drugs give long-term protection so a full new course is needed for each journey. Your doctor or health advisory agency can provide you with up-to-date information on the most appropriate form of preventative treatment for your travel requirements. A recorded telephone advice message on malaria prevention is available on 071-636 7921.     What personal measures can be taken to prevent mosquito bites?   In addition to preventative drug therapy, it is important to take all possible measures to avoid mosquito bites. Protection against mosquitoes is also advisable if passing through a malarial region, or even pausing briefly in an airport transit lounge.    Some simple commonsense measures to reduce the risk of mosquito bites can greatly reduce the risk of developing malaria:     Mosquitos most commonly bite between dusk and dawn. If possible, avoid going out at these times.     Wear a long-sleeved shirt and long trousers if you are going out at night.     Use an insect repellent regularly on all exposed skin.     Avoid sunbathing when mosquitoes are about.     Close all windows at night to keep mosquitoes out. A wire mesh across the windows can also be helpful. Always use air-conditioning, if it is available.     Use mosquito nets over the beds. Check that there are no holes in the net through which mosquitoes may gain entry.       What needs to be remembered on return home?   When you have been travelling in areas where malaria can occur, you should remember the following points:     Frequent exposure to mosquitoes is not necessary: just one bite from an infected mosquito can cause malaria.     It could be five days to a year between being bitten by an infected mosquito and developing the symptoms of malaria.     Make sure that you complete the full course of any preventative drugs on your return.     ConsuIt your doctor immediately if you develop any worrying symptoms and identify which countries you have visited.     If you have received treatment for malaria whilst abroad, inform your doctor in case of a recurrence of the disease.       ",

"    PATIENT INFORMATION LEAFLET ‘AVLOCLOR’ TABLETS Trade Mark        Uses   'Avloclor' (chloroquine phosphate) is recommended for the prevention (prophylaxis) of malaria.    Dosage and Administration to help prevent Malaria   'Avloclor' tablets contain 250 mg of Chloroquine Phosphate BP. The inactive ingredients of 'Avloclor' tablets are magnesium stearate and maize starch. Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to either of these ingredients.   Start taking your tablets at least one day before entering a malarious area. You must continue during the   visit and for 4 weeks after leaving the area  . It is very important to follow these recommendations.   'Avloclor' tablets should be taken after food.    Adults:   (including the elderly): Two tablets taken once a week, on the same day each week.    Children:   Children should be given their dose of 'Avloclor' (see the following table), once a week, on the same day each week.   I - 4 years : 1/2 tablet weekly 5 - 8 years : I tablet weekly 9 - 14 years I l/2 tablets weekly Over 14 years: Adult dose weekly   For a young child, the dose may be administered crushed and mixed with milk, honey or jam.   People who live permanently in malarious areas may acquire partial immunity to malaria and they should obtain individual medical advice before starting malaria prophylaxis.   Malaria prophylaxis is recommended for residents without partial immunity and for travellers to malarious areas as these individuals have little or no immunity to malaria and risk severe attacks.     Precautions   The first time that you take 'Avloclor' you may have blurred vision. Do not drive or operate machinery if this happens to you. If you suffer from either liver or kidney problems or from psoriasis, porphyria (or if anyone in your family has porphyria) or epilepsy, you should take medical advice before taking 'Avloclor'.   Are you pregnant or trying to become pregnant? If so, consult your doctor.   Are you breast feeding? Your baby will still need to be given antimalarial treatment and you should consult your doctor or pharmacist for appropriate advice.   Prolonged administration of 'Avloclor' may very rarely lead to eye damage; if any problems occur with the eyes you should seek immediate medical advice. People taking 'Avloclor' at weekly intervals for the prevention of malaria, for more than three years, should ask their doctor when to have an eye test.    Patients taking 'Avloclor' daily (for conditions other than the prevention of malaria), for more than a year should have eye tests every three months.   Your doctor may advise you to have blood tests if you are taking 'Avloclor' for a long time.   If you accidentally take too many tablets see a doctor immediately.     Undesirable Events   As with all medicines, undesirable events are sometimes experienced. With 'Avloclor' these may include:     headache stomach upset     Other events may sometimes be experienced infrequently or following use for a long period of time:     skin rash or itch hair discolouration or hair loss blurring of vision or difficulty in focusing your eyes convulsions or fits mood changes or other effects on behaviour     Do not be alarmed by this list of possible events. You may not have any of them.   Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you think you have any of these or any other problems with the tablets.     Important Additional Information (Malaria Prevention)   Malaria can be fatal. It is essential to take medical advice on which antimalarial drugs are appropriate. For some countries, 'Avloclor' may not be suitable or may have to be taken with another drug to give maximum protection.   No medication can be guaranteed to protect against malaria in every case. Any traveller becoming ill either when visiting a malarious region or after returning home should suspect malaria and seek medical advice as soon as possible.   In addition to taking antimalarial drugs it is advisable to take other measures. Protect against mosquito bites by wearing light-coloured long-sleeved clothing and long trousers, when out of doors after sunset. Use insect repellent creams on parts of the body not covered by clothing. Sleep in a properly screened room or under a mosquito net. Spray to kill any mosquitoes that may have entered rooms in spite of screening.     ZENECA Limited   Macclesfield	Cheshire	   United Kingdom 9/IE/UK/1016167	  P2138308      ",
"        Bettamousse Betamethasone Valerate 0.12% w/w    PATIENT INFORMATION LEAFLET  PATIENT INFORMATION     This leaflet provides a summary of the information available on your medicine. Please read this leaflet carefully BEFORE you use your medicine. If you have any questions about this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. If the patient is a child aged 6-12 years, please read ""your child"" instead of ""you"" throughout this leaflet, and read the leaflet before the child uses the medicine.     What is your medicine?     Bettamousse contains 0.12%w/w Betamethasone Valerate BP as the active ingredient It also contains cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, polysorbate 60, ethanol, purified water, propylene glycol, citric acid anhydrous, potassium citrate with a propane and butane mixture as the propellant. The container consists of an aluminium can with a valve and a clear cap. The can contains 1009 of the mousse. Betamethasone valerate belongs to a group of medicines known as corticosteroids (or steroids). These reduce inflammation (redness, itchiness and soreness) and should not be confused with the anabolic steroids misused by some athletes.   Product Licence Holder: Evans Medical Ltd, Kingston Road, Leatherhead, Surrey, England, KT22 7PQ Manufacturer: CCL Industries Ltd, Runcorn, England     What is your medicine used for?     Your medicine is used to treat some skin disorders of the scalp that respond to steroid treatment (""steroid responsive dermatoses"") .     Before using this medicine.     Have you used this medicine before and suffered a reaction to it, or are you allergic to any of the ingredients?     Are you pregnant, planning to become pregnant or breastfeeding?     Do you have any infection on your scalp?     Is the patient under the age of six years?      (This medicine is not recommended for children under 6 years of age)   If the answer to any of these questions is   YES  , then tell your doctor (or pharmacist) before taking this medicine, so they can advise you what to do     How to use this medicine.     The mousse should be massaged into the skin of the scalp, and left during the day or evening to take effect The mousse should be applied to the affected areas twice a day, each time using no more than a golf-ball sized amount in total. Once the condition is controlled, this can be reduced to once a day or less Bettamousse should always be used sparingly so use as little as possible when covering the affected areas.   As with all steroid preparations, your doctor will want you to use as little as possible to control the problem, for the shortest possible time You may find that once the condition is controlled, you need only use it every few days to keep it in check.   Adults, the elderly and children over six years of age:         Remove the cap     Turn the can upside down and squirt a golf-ball sized amount on to a saucer.  The mousse melts when it is in contact with skin, so do not squirt it on to the palm of your hand.  If the patient is a child you may need to use less that a golf-ball sized amount – your doctor can advise you about this.     Massage the mousse into the affected areas of your scalp, not your hair.

"      Femodene   This booklet tells you about oral contraceptives in general and about Femodene in detail. Please read it carefully to get the best from Femodene. If you are in any doubt about these instructions contact your doctor, pharmacist or Family Planning clinic.    You and the pill How your body gets ready for pregnancy (the menstrual cycle)   You can usually become pregnant (conceive) from when you start to have periods, up until you are in your late 40s. Every menstrual cycle takes about 28 days. About halfway through this cycle an egg is released from one of your ovaries into a fallopian tube. This is called ovulation.   The egg travels down the fallopian tube towards your womb. When you make love, your partner's penis releases millions of sperm into your vagina. Some of these sperm travel up through your womb into your fallopian tubes. If there is an egg in one of these tubes, and a sperm reaches it, you can become pregnant. This is called 'conception'.   A fertilised egg gets embedded in the lining of your womb and takes 9 months to grow into a baby. As an egg can live for up to 2 days, and sperm for up to 5 days, you can become pregnant if you have made love up to 5 days before ovulation and for some time afterwards. If a sperm does not fertilise an egg, the egg is lost at the end of the menstrual cycle with the lining of your womb. This is called a 'period'.     How do natural hormones work?   Your menstrual cycle is controlled by two sex hormones made by your ovaries: one called oestrogen, the other progesterone (a progestogen). Oestrogen increases during the first half of your menstrual cycle, and makes your womb develop a thick lining, ready to receive the egg if conception happens. Progesterone comes later in the cycle and changes the lining of the womb still further to prepare it for pregnancy.   If you do not become pregnant, you make less of these hormones and this causes the lining of your womb to break down and the lining leaves your body as a period. But during pregnancy, your ovaries, and then the placenta (this attaches the growing baby to the womb and gives it food), carry on making progesterone and oestrogen to stop any more eggs being released.     How does the pill work?   A pill such as Femodene contains hormones which are like those your body produces (oestrogen and progestogen). These help stop you from getting pregnant, just as your natural hormones would stop you conceiving again when you are already pregnant.   The combined contraceptive pill protects you against getting pregnant in 3 ways:     No egg is released to be fertilised by sperm.     The fluid in the neck of your womb thickens so it is more difficult for sperm to enter it.     The lining of your womb does not thicken enough for an egg to grow in it.       How effective is the pill?   The pill is one of the most effective contraceptives apart from sterilisation. But this can only be true when it is taken correctly. So you must follow your doctor's instructions and take the tablets exactly as it says in the next section of this booklet.     Product information The name of your medicine is: Femodene     What does Femodene contain?   Each memo strip of Femodene contains 21 white sugar-coated tablets containing 75 micrograms of the progestogen gestodene and 30 micrograms of the  oestrogen ethinyloestradiol(ethinylestradiol}.Progestogen and oestrogen are both female types of hormone.

Reasons for not taking Femodene   Before taking Femodene, tell your doctor if you have any of these:     you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant.     blood clots in the legs, lungs, eyes, or anywhere else or have ever had these. If you have had a heart attack or if you have any medical condition which makes you more at risk of developing blood clots.     abnormal red blood cells (sickle-cell anaemia).     disorders of blood fat (lipid) metabolism.     cancer of the breast or of the lining of the womb (mammary or endometrial carcinoma) or have ever had either of these conditions.     abnormal bleeding from your vagina of unknown cause.     certain types of jaundice (Dubin-Johnson or Rotor syndromes).     severe diabetes with changes to the blood vessels.     liver tumours or have ever had these.     any other long or short-term liver disease.     allergy to any of the ingredients of Femodene.     Do not take Femodene if you have had any of these conditions when you were pregnant:     itching of your whole body (pruritus of pregnancy.     the rash known as herpes gestationis.     worsening of inherited deafness (otosclerosis).     yellowing of the skin ( jaundice).       What you should know before taking Femodene   Before you start taking Femodene your pelvic organs, breasts and blood pressure should be checked by your doctor and these checks should be repeated regularly. The doctor will also make sure you are not pregnant.   If anyone in your family has had any illness caused by blood clots, or a heart attack, or a stroke at a young age, tell your doctor.   The following conditions need watching carefully while you are taking the pill:   If you have:     severe depressive states, past or present. - varicose veins.     diabetes (diabetes mellitus) or a tendency towards diabetes.     high blood pressure (hypertension).       fits (epilepsy).     the inherited form of deafness known as otosclerosis.     the disease of the nervous system called multiple sclerosis.     the inherited disease called porphyria.     calcium deficiency with cramps (tetany).     the movement disorder called Sydenham's chorea.     breast problems, past or present.     diseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardio vascular diseases).       kidney diseases.     disturbed liver function.     you are very overweight (obese).     an intolerance of contact lenses.     systemic lupus erythematosus-SLE (inflammation of connective tissue).     asthma.     uterine fibroids (benign tumour of the womb).     gallstones.     migraine.     brown patches on the face and body (chloasma). This may be reduced by avoiding too much sunlight.     any disease that is prone to worsen during pregnancy.     or, if:     you have had inflamed veins (phlebitis).     anyone in your family has had breast cancer.     anyone in your family has had any illness caused by blood clots, or a heart attack or stroke at a young age.     If any of these conditions gets worse or you have them for the first time, this may be a sign that you should stop taking Femodene.   When you stop taking Femodene it may take some time for your regular periods to return.     Taking other medicines with Femodene Some medicines may stop Femodene from working   Properly.   If you are taking any other medicine while you are taking Femodene, be sure to tell your doctor (or dentist). Your doctor (or dentist) can tell you whether you should use extra contraceptive precautions and for how long.   Medicines which can sometimes stop Femodene from working properly are antibiotics {such as ampicillin and rifampicin); griseofulvin (which is used to treat fungal infections); phenylbutazone (which is used as an anti-inflammatory drug to treat some types of joint diseases) phenytoin, primidone, phenobarbitone and some other medicines used in people with epilepsy, and carbamazepine (which can be used to treat epilepsy or other illnesses).   If you are taking any of these medicines you might still be able to use Femodene, but you will also need to use an extra contraceptive method Condoms or cap plus spermicide) while you are taking the other medicine and for 7 days after you stop taking it. If your present pack ends before these 7 days, start the next pack the next day without a break. This means taking a pill every day during your normal 7 pill-free days.   If you run two packs together you may not have a period until the end of two packs, but this is not harmful. If you do not have a period after the second pack, you must talk to your doctor before you start the next pack.   If you are taking rifampicin you will need to use another method of contraception as well as Femodene. You should do this while you are taking the rifampicin and for 4 weeks after you stop.   If you are diabetic your doctor may alter the dose of medicine required to treat your diabetes.   If you are in doubt check with your doctor, pharmacist or Family Planning clinic.    Stomach upsets   Being sick or having very bad diarrhoea may stop Femodene from working properly and make it less effective. Carry on taking Femodene as usual, and also use another method of contraception, {condom or cap plus spermicide) until 7 days after you have recovered from the stomach upset. If you finish your pack before these 7 days, start the next pack the next day without a break. This means taking a pill every day during your normal 7 pill-free days. If you run two packs together you may not have a period until the end of two packs, but this is not harmful. If you do not have a period after the second pack, you must talk to your doctor before starting the next pack. If your stomach upset continues for some time, consult your doctor who may consider another form of contraception.     Warnings   It has been suggested, on the basis of statistical evidence, that the risk of developing various disorders of the circulation of the blood is slightly greater in women who take the combined pill than in those who do not. This can lead to, for example, deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in the leg), strokes (blood clots and haemorrhages from the blood vessels of the brain), heart attacks or pulmonary embolism (blood clots blocking the arteries of the lungs). People do not always fully recover from these disorders, and, very rarely, they are fatal. Studies suggest that these disorders occur less often with modern low-dose oral contraceptives than with older pills.   Certain conditions increase the risk of thrombosis. They include:     smoking.     obesity.     some diseases of the heart and blood vessels.     diabetes.     migraine.     a major operation or period of immobilisation (e.g. you are in bed after an accident or operation or you have a plaster cast on a broken leg).     if any members of your family have suffered from thromboembolic diseases {e.g. deep vein thrombosis, stroke or heart attack) at a young age.     varicose veins.     If any of these conditions apply to you before you decide to take Femodene or while you are taking Femodene you must discuss them with your doctor.   The risk of arterial thrombosis (e.g. heart attack and stroke) associated with the pill increases with age and this risk is increased by cigarette smoking. For this reason, the use of combined pills by women in the older age-group, especially those who also smoke, is discouraged.   Signs and symptoms of blood clots are given in the section Reasons for stopping Femodene immediately .   The pill does give a substantial degree of protection against cancers of the ovary and the lining of the womb. An increased risk of cervical cancer in long-term users of the pill has been reported in some studies. It is uncertain whether this increased risk is caused by the pill as it could be due to the effects of sexual behaviour and other factors.   The evidence linking use of the pill and breast cancer is unclear. Some studies suggest an increased risk of breast cancer in women below the age of 35, the risk increasing the longer the pill is used. Any possible increased risk of breast cancer with combined pills is, however, likely to be small.   The combination of ethinyloestradiol and gestodene, like other contraceptives, has been linked with an increased incidence of abnormal growths in the rat liver, but it is unclear whether this could happen in humans. On rare occasions, the use of the pill has led to liver diseases such as jaundice and benign liver tumours and, very rarely, it has been associated with some forms of malignant liver tumours (cancer) in long-term users. Liver tumours may lead to life-threatening intra-abdominal haemorrhage (bleeding in the abdomen). Therefore, if you have pain in the upper abdomen that does not soon clear up, tell your doctor. Also, if your skin becomes yellow ( jaundice) you must tell your doctor.   If you think you might be pregnant, stop taking Femodene and consult your doctor immediately. Use another method of contraception such as a condom until you see your doctor.   Certain conditions may sometimes get worse during use of the pill. The diseases are those listed under ""What you should know before taking Femodene"".    Reasons for stopping Femodene immediately   If you experience any of the following conditions, take no further tablets of Femodene and consult your     The bleeding you have after each pack (including the last pack) is not a true period. Your doctor relies on the date of your last true period before you get pregnant to tell you when your baby will be born. So, if you stop taking Femodene to have a baby, use     ",

"    ADENOCOR Adenosine    Presentation   Adenocor is a sterile solution for intravenous injection provided in clear glass vials. Each vial contains 6 mg of adenosine in 2 ml of a 0.9% w/v solution of sodium chloride in sterile Water For Injections Ph. Eur.     Uses Therapeutic Indications   Rapid conversion to a normal sinus rhythm of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias, including those associated with accessory by-pass tracts (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome).    Diagnostic Indications   Aid to diagnosis of broad or narrow complex supraventricular tachycardias. Although Adenocor is not effective in converting atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia to sinus rhythm, the slowing of AV conduction helps diagnosis of atrial activity.   Sensitisation of intra-cavitary electrophysiological investigations.      Mode of Action   Adenocor administered by rapid intravenous injection slows conduction through the AV node. This action can interrupt re-entry circuits involving the AV node and restore normal sinus rhythm in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias. Once the circuit has been interrupted, the tachycardia stops and normal sinus rhythm is re-established.   By transiently stowing AV conduction, atrial activity is easier to evaluate from ECG recordings and therefore Adenocor can aid the diagnosis of broad or narrow complex tachycardias.   Adenocor may be useful during electrophysiological studies to determine the site of AV block or to determine, in some cases of pre-excitation, whether conduction is occurring by an accessory pathway or via the AV node.     Dosage and Administration   Adenocor is intended for hospital use only. It should be administered by rapid IV bogus injection according to the ascending dosage schedule below. To be certain the solution reaches the systemic circulation administer either directly into a vein or into an IV line. If given into an IV line it should be injected as proximally as possible, and followed by a rapid saline flush.   Adenocor should only be used when facilities exist for cardiac monitoring. Patients who develop high-level AV block at a particular dose should not be given further dosage increments.     Therapeutic Dose    Adults:    Initial dose:   3 mg given as a rapid intravenous bogus Lover 2 seconds}.    Second dose:   If the first dose does not result in elimination of the supraventricular tachycardia within 1 to 2 minutes, 6 mg should be given also as a rapid intravenous bogus.    Third Dose:   If the second dose does not result in elimination of the supraventricular tachycardia within 1 to 2 minutes, 12mg should be given also as a rapid intravenous bogus.   Additional or higher doses are not recommended.     Children:   No controlled paediatric study has been undertaken. Published uncontrolled studies show similar effects of adenosine in adults and children; effective doses for children were between 0.0375 and 0.25 mg/kg.     Elderly:   See dosage recommendations for adults.    Diagnostic Dose   The above ascending dosage schedule should be employed until sufficient diagnostic information has been obtained.    Contraindications, Warnings etc.     Contra-indications   Adenocor is contra-indicated in patients suffering from:     second or third degree AV block (except in patients with a functioning artificial pacemaker).     sick sinus syndrome (except in patients with a functioning artificial pacemaker).       Warnings:   Patients with atrial fibrillation/flutter and an accessory by-pass tract may develop increased conduction down the anomalous pathway.   Since neither the kidney nor the liver are involved in the degradation of exogenous adenosine, the efficacy of Adenocor should be unaffected by hepatic or renal insufficiency.   It has been reported that inhaled adenosine caused bronchial constriction in asthmatic patients but not in healthy individuals. However a limited number of asthmatic patients have received adenosine intravenously without suffering aggravation of symptoms. Nevertheless physicians should be aware of the possibility.     Side Effects:   Facial flush, dyspnoea, a feeling of thoracic constriction, nausea and lightheadedness occur commonly. More rarely observed side-effects have been: feeling of discomfort; sweating; palpitations; hyperventilation; head pressure; apprehension; blurred vision; burning sensation; bradycardia; chest pains; headache; dizziness; heaviness in arms; arm, back and neck pains; metallic taste. These side effects were mild, of short duration (usually less than 1 minute) and generally well-tolerated by the patient.   Severe bradycardia has been reported and some patients have required temporary pacing. The effects of Adenocor are not blocked by atropine.   At the time of conversion to normal sinus rhythm, the ECG may show premature ventricular contractions, premature atrial contractions, sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia, skipped beats and varying degrees of AV nodal block. These abnormalities generally last only a few seconds and have been self limiting.     Drug Interactions:   As dipyridamole is a known inhibitor of adenosine uptake, it may potentiate the action of Adenocor; in one study dipyridamole was shown to produce a 4 fold increase in adenosine actions. It is therefore suggested that Adenocor should not be administered to patients receiving dipyridamole; if use of Adenocor is essential, dosage should be reduced.   Theophylline and other xanthines such as caffeine are known strong inhibitors of adenosine.   Adenocor may interact with drugs tending to impair cardiac conduction.     Women of Child-Bearing Age:   Adenosine is a substance which is naturally present in some form in all cells of the body, therefore no effect on the foetus would be expected. In the absence of evidence that adenosine does not cause foetal harm, Adenocor should only be used during pregnancy where absolutely necessary.     Overdosage:   No cases of overdosage have been reported. As the half life of adenosine in blood is very short, the duration of any side effects due to overdose is likely to be limited.       Pharmaceutical Precautions   Do not refrigerate. Any portion of the vial not used at once should be discarded.

"      PATIENT INFORMATION LEAFLET   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––          PLEASE READ THIS LEAFLET CAREFULLY BEFORE USING CANESTEN AF CREAM     What is Athlete's Foot?   Athlete's foot is the common name for the fungal infection Tinea pedis.  It is caused by a group of fungi called dermatophytes.  The name ""athlete's foot"" arose because this is an infection which is commonly, although not exclusively, suffered by people whose feet perspire or who use communal changing rooms.   Athlete's foot is highly contagious and infected skin shed on changing room floors or on towels can easily transfer the infection.  The discomfort caused by the infection can be made worse by wearing shoes, particularly if they are made from synthetic materials which do not allow the feet to ""breathe"".  The key triggers of athlete's foot include warmth, moisture and friction.  The latter can damage the tissue allowing the fungus to take hold.     CANESTEN AF CREAM     What does Canesten AF Cream contain?   The cream contains 1.0% of the active ingredient Clotrimazole BP.   Canesten AF Cream also contains benzyl alcohol, polysorbate 60, sorbitan stearate, cetyl esters wax, cetyl stearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol and purified water.   The cream comes in a tube containing 15g.   Clotrimazole is one of a group of medicines called imidazoles which are used to treat fungal infections.      When should I use Canesten AF Cream?   The cream is used to treat athlete's foot.  If you are unsure whether you have athlete’s foot, seek the advice of your doctor or pharmacist (chemist).   The cream can also be used to treat other fungal skin infections.     When should I not use Canesten AF Cream?   Do not use Canesten AF Cream if you have previously had an allergic reaction to the active ingredient clotrimazole.  If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor or pharmacist.     What special precautions should I take?   If you are pregnant or are planning a family, tell your doctor or pharmacist before using the cream.  If you have informed your doctor or pharmacist already, follow their instructions carefully.     How do I use Canesten AF Cream?     For athlete's foot, wash your feet and dry them thoroughly, especially between the toes, before applying the cream.     Smooth the cream over the affected area and rub in gently making sure that you massage cream between the toes.     The cream should be applied two or three times daily and treatment should be continued for at least one month to prevent re-infection.     It may help if you use an anti-fungal dusting powder as well.  Ask your pharmacist to recommend one.      If symptoms persist, consult your doctor.      PRODUCT LICENCE HOLDER:    Bayer plc Pharmaceutical Division Bayer House Strawberry Hill Newbury Berkshire RG14 1JA     MANUFACTURER:     Bayer AG Leverkusen Germany –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––   You can help the treatment to work and prevent further athlete's foot infections if you follow these simple self-help tips:     Wash your socks, stockings or tights thoroughly in hot water to remove any shed skin or fungal spores.     Wash your feet every day in warm, soapy water and dry thoroughly, especially between the toes but avoid excessive rubbing.     Although your feet and toes will itch, do not scratch them.  Scratching will damage the surface of the skin and cause the infection to spread further     Never share towels or bath mats.     Change your socks, stockings or tights every day.     If you are still worried or have any questions about the symptoms or the treatment of athlete's foot, do not hesitate to ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice.

What should I do if I forget to use my Canesten AF Cream?   Apply the cream as soon as possible and then continue the rest of your treatment as usual.     What side-effects may I experience?

Canesten AF Cream may cause side-effects in some people.  You may experience a mild burning or irritation immediately after applying the cream.  If you find this intolerable, stop treatment and seek advice from your doctor or pharmacist.   If, upon first use of the cream, you experience a rash and itching, tell your doctor immediately as you may be allergic to this product.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO READ THIS CAREFULLY BEFORE STARTING TREATMENT   Following this advice gives the ointment a chance to work safely and effectively.    What is in your ointment   Betnovate rectal ointment is one of a group of medicines called topical steroids. ""Topical"" means they are put on the skin. Topical steroids reduce the redness and itchiness of certain skin problems. (They should not be confused with ""anabolic"" steroids misused by some body builders and taken as tablets or injections).   Betnovate rectal ointment also contains lignocaine to reduce pain and itchiness and phenylephrine to help to reduce any swelling.   Ingredients of the ointment include:   The main active ingredient - betamethasone valerate 0.05% a local anaesthetic  - lignocaine hydrochloride 2.5% a vasoconstrictor - phenylephrine hydrochloride 0.1% in a base containing microcrystalline wax and liquid paraffin.   The ointment does not contain any lanolin, parabens or colouring agents.     Before you use your ointment   This ointment has been prescribed to treat the problem you saw your doctor about.   DO NOT put it on any other skin problems as it could make them worse, especially:   acne skin infections such as cold sores, herpes, impetigo, athletes foot, chicken pox, ringworm, thrush If you have had an allergy to any creams, ointments or local anaesthetics in the past   If you think you may be pregnant.   Did you tell your doctor at the last visit or an earlier visit?   IF YOU DID   NOT   TELL YOUR DOCTOR THEN YOU SHOULD DO SO   BEFORE   STARTING THE TREATMENT   Even so, your doctor may still want you to use the ointment.    Children   - DO NOT use on a child under one year of age     How to use your ointment   If your doctor has told you in detail HOW MUCH to use and HOW OFTEN then keep to this advice.   If you are not sure then follow the advice on the back of this leaflet.   Unless told by your doctor:   -YOU SHOULD NOT use more than this.   -A course of treatment should not last more than seven days -YOU SHOULD NOT repeat such courses several times in a short period of time.   Overuse like this may:   - thin the skin so that it damages easily - allow the active ingredient to pass through the skin and affect other parts of the body, especially in children.   If your problem does not improve in seven days tell your doctor.      Has the ointment any side effects?      Most people find using this ointment causes no problems when used in the right amount for the correct length of time. (See above as well as guidance on back of this leaflet).   IF you find your condition gets worse during treatment you may be allergic to the ointment or have a skin infection.    STOP USING THE OINTMENT AND TELL YOUR DOCTOR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE   Repeated courses of topical steroids over a long time may sometimes cause changes in hair growth and skin colour.      Further guidance on how to use your ointment   If your doctor has told you in detail how to use the ointment then keep to that advice otherwise:–      To treat the area around the back passage   Two or three times a day, after washing your hands, gently rub a small amount of ointment into the area to be treated, then wash your hands again. As the problem gets better you may find you only need to do this once a day.     If you want to put some ointment inside the back passage     Wash your hands.     Unscrew the cap of the tube and firmly screw on the applicator.     Squeeze out a little ointment and smear it around the applicator.     Bend forward, squat or stand up with one leg raised on a chair, whichever is most comfortable, and gently insert the applicator into your back passage.     Squeeze the tube gently and pull it away slowly at the same time.     Wipe the nozzle clean with a soft tissue and wash your hands again.      What to do with any unused ointment   If your doctor stops your treatment, return any unused ointment to a pharmacist. Only keep it if your doctor tells you to.   Do not use the ointment after the expiry date on the tube end or carton.     Remember   This ointment was prescribed for YOU so never give it to someone else to try – even if they seem to have the same problem. There may be reasons why it could harm that person.

"    Special Advice Children   There is no experience of use in children. Therefore, it should not be used in children.    Elderly   The same dosage should be used as for Adults.     Pregnancy   Tell your doctor BEFORE you are given Innohep if you are pregnant, might be pregnant or you are breast feeding.     What medical checks will you have?   Most people receiving Innohep do not have regular tests to check levels of tinzaparin sodium in their blood since it is not necessary to monitor this treatment.   If you have blood tests for other reasons, tell your doctor or nurse that you are receiving Innohep. It could affect the results. Do not miss appointments with your doctor.    Injecting Innohep   Innohep is usually administered by a health Care professional by injection under the skin. It is usually given once a day for at least 6 days depending on your own response to the medicine. The dose given will depend upon your weight.      What if you are given too much Innohep?   This may result in bleeding which can be reversed by giving an injection of protamine sulphate. This will usually be given by a health care professional.     Does Innohep have side effects?   Innohep can sometimes have side effects but these are rare.   These include: skin rashes, bruising at the injection site and allergic reactions such as hot flushes, difficulty in breathing skin itching and redness. The most serious is blood in your urine or bowel motions or bleeding from your nose which is due to a decrease of cells in your blood. Like other agents which stop the blood from clotting, it also increases the incidence of bleeding. Frequently there is an increase in an enzyme level in your blood (transaminase) but this does not usually mean that you have to stop your treatment.    If you feel unwell or notice anything unusual or which you do not understand, tell your doctor as soon as possible.     Remember, this treatment is for you. Only a doctor can prescribe it for you. Do not let other people use your medicine.      Storing Innohep   Innohep should be stored at room temperature in a safe place out of the reach of children.   Once opened, use within 14 days.   Do not use after the expiry date given on the label.    Date Leaflet Last Revised: November 1995    Registered Trade Mark      ",
"    Patient Information Leaflet   Please read this information carefully before taking Ciproxin tablets       What do my tablets contain?   Each tablet contains 750mg of the active ingredient ciprofloxacin.   Ciproxin tablets 750mg also contain maize starch, microcrystalline cellulose, crospovidone, colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose 2910, polyethylene glycol 4000 and the colouring agent titanium dioxide   The tablets come in packs of 10, 20 and 100, but your doctor will prescribe as many as you need.  However, your doctor may give you a starter pack containing two Ciproxin tablets to start your course of treatment.   The ciprofloxacin contained in Ciproxin is one of a group of antibiotics called quinolones which work by killing bacteria that cause infections.     Product Licence/Authorisation holder:   Manufacturer:    Bayer plc Pharmaceutical Division Bayer House Strawberry Hill Newbury, Berkshire RG14 1JA Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany    Why have I been prescribed Ciproxin tablets by my doctor?   Ciproxin tablets have been prescribed by your doctor to treat your bacterial infection.  Some of the infections which Ciproxin can be used to treat are:   Chest infections, e.g. bronchitis.   Infections of the urinary tract, e.g. cystitis.   Intestinal infections, e.g. infective diarrhoea.     When should I not take Ciproxin tablets?   Do not take Ciproxin tablets if you have previously had an allergic reaction to the active ingredient ciprofloxacin or any other quinolone antibiotics. If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor.   Generally, Ciproxin should not be given to children and adolescents unless considered essential by a doctor.  As with other antibiotics in this group, Ciproxin may cause pain and swelling in the developing joints of these patients.     What special precautions should I take?   If you are pregnant, planning a family or breast-feeding, tell your doctor before taking Ciproxin as it is not recommended for use under these conditions.  If you have already informed your doctor, follow his/her instructions carefully.   Providing you do not have a problem with your heart or kidneys, you should drink plenty of liquid whilst taking Ciproxin. Ciproxin may cause a problem with your kidneys called ""crystalluria"" which results in tiny crystals forming in the urine.  These crystals cannot be seen by the naked eye.  Drinking plenty of liquid can help prevent this occurring.  However, if you experience pain or discomfort when passing urine whilst you are taking Ciproxin, tell your doctor.   If you have a problem with your kidneys, tell your doctor before taking Ciproxin.  Your doctor may wish to change your dose to allow for any reduced kidney function.   If you have previously had ""fits"" or suffer from epilepsy or if you have ever suffered other conditions related to the nervous supply to the brain, tell your doctor before taking Ciproxin tablets.   Ciproxin may make you feel less alert, particularly when taken with alcohol.  Therefore, make sure you know how you react to Ciproxin before you drive or operate machinery. If in doubt, consult your doctor.   If you have a family history of or know that you have the hereditary condition G6PD, deficiency remind your doctor before taking Ciproxin.  This condition causes a deficiency of certain chemicals in the red blood cells and, if Ciproxin is taken, it may lead to the breaking down of red blood cells resulting in anaemia and yellowing of the skin (jaundice).   Ciproxin may occasionally cause pain and inflammation around your tendons particularly if you are elderly or taking one of a group of medicines called steroids such as hydrocortisone.  If you experience these symptoms, seek medical advice immediately and rest the affected limb.  Do not take the next dose of Ciproxin tablets unless your doctor tells you to.   Certain medicines are known to affect the action of Ciproxin and are best avoided whilst taking it.  Therefore, ask your doctor for advice if you wish to take antacids for indigestion or any other preparations containing aluminum, calcium, magnesium or iron whilst taking Ciproxin.  If these preparations are essential, they must not be taken within four hours of taking Ciproxin tablets.  If you take multivitamins or minerals, check that they do not contain iron, calcium or magnesium. If they do, your doctor may want you to stop taking them whilst you are taking Ciproxin.   Remind your doctor if you are taking drugs that thin the blood (anticoagulants) such as warfarin, or any medicines used to relieve pain and inflammation (e.g. fenbufen) except for aspirin.   If you are taking glibenclamide for diabetes, remind your doctor as Ciproxin sometimes increases the ability of glibenclamide to lower blood sugar and may result in hypoglycaemia (ie a ""hypo"").   Remind your doctor if you are taking probenecid or metoclopramide as these drugs may affect the level of Ciproxin in your blood.   If you are taking cyclosporin at the same time as Ciproxin, your doctor may want to take regular blood samples to monitor the level of a substance called creatinine in your blood.   If you take theophylline for asthma, remind your doctor as he/she may want to monitor the level of theophylline in your blood. This is particularly important if you suffer from ""fits"" or convulsions.    If you go into hospital for surgery, have dental treatment which requires an anaesthetic or you need to provide a blood or urine sample, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking Ciproxin tablets.      When and how do I take Ciproxin tablets?   The dosage of Ciproxin required and the duration of treatment depends upon the severity and type of your infection.   Take the tablets as prescribed by your doctor.  Usually this will be one tablet taken twice daily. The tablet(s) should be swallowed whole with a glass of water.  Drink several more glasses of water during every day of your treatment, unless told otherwise by your doctor.   Take the tablets for as long as directed by your doctor.  The usual duration of treatment is between 3 and 10 days, but it may be longer if your infection is more persistent or severe.  It is important that you complete the course of treatment, even if you begin to feel better after a few days.  If you stop taking this medicine too soon, your symptoms may return    DO NOT EXCEED THE PRESCRIBED DOSE    If you take more than the prescribed dose, or in the event of an overdose, seek medical advice immediately and, if possible, take your tablets or the box with you to show the doctor.       What should I do if I forget to take my Ciproxin tablets?   Take your normal dose as soon as possible and then continue as prescribed.  However, if it is almost time for your next dose, do not take the missed dose and continue as usual, making sure that you complete your course of treatment.     What side-effects may I experience?   As can happen with some antibiotics, certain side-effects have been reported after Ciproxin.  You may experience diarrhoea, feeling sick (nausea), vomiting, indigestion, stomach-ache, wind, difficulty in swallowing, loss of appetite, headache, restlessness, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, skin rashes and itching.   Rarely, a disorder called pseudomembranous colitis can occur which causes attacks of diarrhoea containing blood and mucus.  Consult your doctor immediately if this occurs.   If you experience ""fits"", trembling, hallucinations, very severe headaches with visual disturbances, increased sleepiness, sleep disorders or feel anxious, confused or depressed, consult your doctor as soon as possible.   Rarely, people have experienced visual disturbances, impaired sense of taste and smell, ringing in the ears and, sometimes, impaired hearing which returns to normal once treatment with Ciproxin finishes.   Ciproxin may cause joint or tendon swelling with pain which may lead to tendon rupture.  If you experience these symptoms, seek medical advice immediately and rest the affected limb.  Do not take the next dose of Ciproxin tablets unless your doctor tells you to.  Ciproxin can also cause muscle pain.   As with all medicines, some people may be allergic to Ciproxin.  Usually, if you are allergic to Ciproxin, a reaction will occur soon after you start taking the tablets.  An allergic reaction can appear as a rash, hives, itching, small red spots on the skin or a fever.  Very rarely, an allergy to Ciproxin can cause swelling of the blood vessels in the skin and severe skin reactions such as large fluid-filled blisters, sores and ulceration.  Ulceration can also occur in the mouth and throat, around the anus and genital region and on the surface of the eyes.  These symptoms are often accompanied by sickness, headache and fever.    If you experience any of these symptoms, stop the treatment and seek medical advice immediately  .   The skin of some people may become more sensitive to the sun whilst taking Ciproxin.  Avoid too much sun and do not use a sun lamp until you know how you react when taking Ciproxin.  If in doubt, consult your doctor.   Ciproxin has been known to cause effects on the liver such as inflammation (hepatitis) and yellow jaundice.  It may also cause effects on the kidney which lead to pain and discomfort when passing water (crystalluria).  If you notice yellowing of your skin or any change in your urine output or appearance, possibly accompanied by kidney pain, seek medical advice immediately.  Ciproxin may affect certain components in the blood.  This may lead to bruising, jaundice, a persistent sore throat, fever with tiredness or a general feeling of being unwell.    IF YOU EXPERIENCE ANY OF THESE EFFECTS OR ANY OTHER UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS, TELL YOUR DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY.  YOUR DOCTOR WILL GIVE YOU ADVICE.      How should I store my Ciproxin tablets?   No special precautions are required but it is best to keep Ciproxin tablets in the original box in a cool, dry place.    KEEP ALL MEDICINES OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN   Do not use tablets after the expiry date which is marked on both the outer carton and on each blister strip of tablets.  Wherever you see ""EXP"" this means ""expiry date"", for example, EXP 02/98 means that your tablets must not be used after February 1998.   If you find that you have tablets after their expiry date, return them to your local pharmacist (chemist) who will dispose of them properly.    Date of Preparation: May 1995    Remember: This medicine has been prescribed for you.  Do not give it to anyone else under any circumstances, even if they have the same condition as you.  If you have any doubts about taking Ciproxin tablets correctly, seek the advice of your doctor or pharmacist.

"    Timoptol Unit Dose Ophthalmic Solution (timolol maleate, MSD)   PLEASE READ BOTH SIDES OF THIS LEAFLET CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU START USING THESE EYE DROPS      WHY DOES YOUR DOCTOR WANT YOU     TO USE EYE DROPS?    Your Condition   Your doctor has done some tests and has shown that you have a condition which causes a raised pressure in your eye(s). There are a number of different causes - such as glaucoma. Your doctor will explain which affects you.     Your Treatment   'Timoptol' eye drops contain timolol maleate BP at a strength of either 0.25% or 0.5%. This is one of a group of chemicals called beta-blockers. These reduce the pressure in your eye(s).    HOW SHOULD YOU USE THE DROPS?    Each 'Timoptol' Unit Dose container has enough 'Timoptol' for one treatment.    First, wash your hands. Remove the strip of containers from the foil pouch, then pull off one of the containers from the end of the strip - it will break off quite easily (Fig. 1). To put the drops into your eye, twist the top off the container (Fig. 2). Then tilt your head backwards and pull the bottom lid of your eye downwards to form a pocket (Fig. 3). Hold the Unit Dose container in your other hand between your thumb and your first finger. Place the tip close to your lower eyelid and squeeze the container gently (Fig. 4). One drop of solution should fall into your eye. Put the container down and press your finger against the inside corner of your eye for at least a minute - this helps stop the drops from draining down the back of your nose into  your throat. Repeat the process with the other eye if your doctor says you should treat both eyes.   Throw the container away and wash your hands again. Do not use the container more than once.

The dose will depend on your condition, how quickly you respond, and whether you are taking any other treatment. Usually the first dose is one drop of 0.25% solution twice a day: some people need a stronger dose, and others need less. Your doctor will change your treatment as necessary.      KEEP USING ‘TIMOPTOL’   It is important that you do not stop the treatment without talking to your doctor first. You may not feel any different, but the drops are helping to reduce the pressure in your eye(s) - you should use them until your doctor says you no longer need them.

These tablets will cause a monthly period and help protect the womb from cancer.     How much?   The dose is chosen by your doctor.   Usually a dose of 25, 50 or 100 mg is given, but this varies from person to person. This dose will last between 4 and 8 months.     How is the implant given?   The implants are inserted under the skin around the lower part of the abdomen, or the buttock. You will usually be given a local anaesthetic in this area before the implants are inserted. The small cut made will be dressed with a bandage afterwards.     What if you are accidentally given too much?   There is no need to worry. Your doctor may decide not to give you more oestrogen until the amount in your body is back to normal.     What to do if Oestradiol Implants are swallowed accidentally   If someone has swallowed some implants by accident there is no need to worry. However, you should consult a doctor.   The person may feel sick or be sick. Women may have some vaginal bleeding after a few days.     What may happen when your treatment is finished   When you finish your treatment with oestradiol implants or the implant has been removed for some reason, your doctor may give you some progestogen tablets to take until withdrawal bleeding stops (if you have not had a hysterectomy).     What about side-effects?   Oestradiol Implants sometimes cause side effects in some people.     These usually settle down during treatment as the body adjusts to the medicine.     If you have any of these side effects, tell your doctor. He may decide to stop your treatment for a while.     You may have bleeding between your periods. Tell your doctor if vaginal bleeding occurs.   You may notice an increased vaginal discharge.   If you have endometriosis or fibroids in the womb they may get worse. You may have pre-menstrual syndrome.   Sometimes the breasts become swollen, tender or painful, or there may be a milky discharge.   Some people may feel sick or be sick.   Some people may have gall-stones or jaundice.   Your blood pressure may increase.   There may be more chance of having a blood-clot (thrombosis).   You may have skin problems such as a rash or an allergy to the sun.   If you wear contact lenses you may feel some irritation in the eyes.   Very occasionally headaches occur, sometimes migraine.   You may notice that your mood changes.   You may have fluid retention such as swollen ankles.   Your weight may change.   If you have an implant and have not ever had your womb removed you may need to take progestogen tablets, otherwise you may increase the risk of developing heart disease, kidney disease, skin cancer,   deafness (caused by thickened ear tissues), multiple sclerosis or an inflammatory disease that may affect the whole body (systemic lupus erythematosus).   Tell your doctor about any problems that you think might be caused by the implants.     How should you store this medicine?   Do not use this medicine after the ""use by"" date on the pack. Keep the implants below 25°C (room temperature) away from the light. Keep the implants in the original box where children cannot see or reach them .   This information was written in September 1995.     Other things to remember about medicines     This medicine has been prescribed for your current medical problems. Do not take it for other medical problems.     Do not allow other people to take your medicines and do not take medicines meant for other people.     Tell any doctor treating you what medicines you are taking. Always carry a medical information card stating which medicines you are taking. This can also be very important in case you are involved in an accident.     Return unused medicines to the pharmacy for disposal .      Make sure that other people you may live with or who look after you read this information.       More about Oestradiol Implants   Oestradiol Implants contain oestradiol, one of the natural female sex hormones (oestrogens or estrogens).   Oestrogens are produced in the ovaries. They cause sexual development in women and control the menstrual cycle during the childbearing years. When women get older the ovaries gradually produce less oestrogen. This happens at the menopause (usually around the age of 50). If the ovaries are removed surgically (ovariectomy) before the menopause, oestrogen production stops very suddenly.   Shortage of oestrogens may lead to complaints such as hot flushes and night sweats. Some women feel depressed and lose their sex drive. The shortage of oestrogen may also cause thinning of bones (osteoporosis). Over the years the bones become brittle and break easily. Oestradiol can prevent osteoporosis.   These complaints can be relieved by taking medicines containing oestrogen. However it may take several days or weeks before you notice an improvement.     ",

These include hot flushes, night sweats, tiredness, sleeplessness, depression and irritability.

"      Vagifem    Estradiol What you should know about Vagifem   Please read this leaflet carefully before you start to use this product. The leaflet does not contain all of the information about the product that you may need to know, so please ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.     What is in your medicine   Each Vagifem vaginal tablet contains 25 microgrammes of estradiol.   Other ingredients are: E464, lactose, maize starch, magnesium stearate and polyethylene glycol 6000.   Vagifem is a vaginal tablet containing a small dose of estradiol (an oestrogen). The vaginal tablet is inserted into the vagina, and the estradiol acts locally on the vagina. Each white Vagifem tablet comes in an applicator which is used once only. There are 15 applicators with vaginal tablets in each box. Vagifem is one of a group of hormone replacement therapies called topical (or local) HRT.   The manufacturer and product licence holder is:   Novo Nordisk A/S  , Novo Allé, DK-2880 Bagsvaerd, Den mark     What is Vagifem for?   Vagifem is prescribed to relieve or eliminate symptoms in the vagina such as dryness or irritation. In medical terms this is known as atrophic vaginitis. It is caused by a loss of the female sex hormone, oestrogen, which occurs around the menopause.   The menopause is the time of a woman's last period. Before the menopause oestrogen is important in keeping the vagina moist. When the amount of this hormone falls before and after the menopause, some women get a drying and thinning of the vagina which can lead to soreness, discomfort during sexual intercourse, and possible infection. These symptoms may often start years after the menopause when amounts of oestrogen in the body have become very low. By treating your vagina with the oestrogen your body no longer produces, Vagifem relieves or eliminates these symptoms.     Important questions before using Vagifem     Have you had cancer of the breast or endometrium (lining of the womb)     Have you recently had any vaginal bleeding, other than during a period?     Have you had phlebitis (inflamed veins), DVT (deep vein thrombosis), blood clots in the lungs, or stroke, associated with previous oestrogen use?     Are you pregnant?     If you have answered Yes to any of these questions, tell your doctor or pharmacist before starting Vagifem.     Precautions   Your doctor will carry out gynaecological and breast examinations as appropriate for you, and will treat any vaginal infection before you start with Vagifem.   It has been established that the risk of endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the womb) is increased after treatment with higher doses of oestrogen given by mouth. Vagifem is a local treatment with a low dose of oestrogen and even though a minor degree of absorption of the oestrogen may occur, this side effect is most unlikely.   Tell your doctor if you have any persistent or recurring vaginal bleeding during use of Vagifem.   There has been concern about the possible risk of breast cancer with oestrogen treatment. Many studies have not shown any increase in breast cancer but some have shown a small increase after prolonged treatment (five years or more). All of these studies have involved higher doses of oestrogen given by mouth. Because of the low dose and local treatment with Vagifem any effect on the risk of breast cancer is unlikely.   Vagifem should not be used by children or males.      Vagifem and other diseases   There are certain conditions with which it is probably quite safe to use Vagifem, but please do remind your doctor if you have any of the conditions mentioned below, as he may want to keep a closer eye on your condition than would otherwise be the case. If your condition worsens whilst using Vagifem, stop using Vagifem and tell your doctor. The conditions are: inflamed veins, blood clots in the legs or lungs, stroke or heart attack, or a past history of these conditions; liver disease or previous liver disease where liver function tests have not returned to normal; inherited blood disorders; epilepsy; migraine; diabetes; asthma; heart trouble; high blood pressure.     Contraception   If you have passed the menopause you cannot become pregnant. If you are fertile or are not sure if you have passed the menopause, you should be aware that Vagifem is not a contraceptive. If you become pregnant whilst using Vagifem you must stop using It.     Using your Vagifem   You can start using Vagifem on any convenient day. The white vaginal tablet is inserted deeply within the vagina using the disposable applicator.   The usual dose is one tablet inserted into the vagina each day for two weeks, and then one tablet inserted twice per week for a further 10 weeks. At the end of this treatment your doctor will usually decide whether further treatment is required or not.   To insert the tablet follow the diagrams shown below. Each applicator containing one tablet, is wrapped in a blister pack backed with foil. The applicator with tablet must be removed from this pack just before insertion.     Overdosage   Because of the low dose of estradiol in Vagifem, using too many should not cause serious problems. However, if you think you have used more than you should, contact your doctor for advice.     Missing a tablet   If you forget to insert a tablet on any given day, continue from the next day on which you were due to use Vagifem. You can stop treatment with Vagifem at any time' but symptoms may return. Tell your doctor if you stop or want to stop treatment.     Possible side effects   Only a few side effects have been reported during use of Vagifem. These include slight vaginal bleeding, vaginal discharge and skin rash.   Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you experience recurring vaginal bleeding, any unusual discomfort you do not understand or any other unwanted effect not mentioned above.     How to keep your tablets   Store Vagifem in a dry place, protected from light (keep the bubble strips in the box).   Store at room temperature, below 25 C. Do not keep in a refrigerator.   The expiry date is printed on the foil of the bubble pack and on the outer box. Do not use the tablets after this date.   Keep your Vagifem away from children.   If your doctor decides to stop the treatment return any left over tablets and applicators to the pharmacist.    Date of last revision of this leaflet: November 1995          How to use Vagifem       Tear off one single blister pack and open at the push button end of the pack by pressing as shown note the tablet is contained in the other end of the applicator. Do not get the tablet wet.      Standing with one foot on a chair, or Iying on your back, insert the applicator, tablet end first, into the vagina as far as it will comfortably go. You will probably have inserted the applicator approximately four inches. When inserting the applicator, take care to hold it either side, and not to push the button at the end until the applicator is fully inserted.       Press the push button at the end of the applicator until a click is felt. This click indicates that the tablet has been released from the end of the applicator. The tablet will stick to the wall of the vagina. It will not fall out if you stand up or walk.      Withdraw the applicator and throw it away - it cannot be flushed down the lavatory.

"      Eugynon 30   This leaflet tells you about oral contraceptives in general and about Eugynon 30 in detail. Please read it carefully to get the best from Eugynon 30. If you are in any doubt about these instructions contact your doctor, pharmacist or Family Planning clinic.    You and the pill How your body gets ready for pregnancy (the menstrual cycle)   You can usually become pregnant (conceive) from when you start to have periods, up until you are in your late 40s. Every menstrual cycle takes about 28 days. About halfway through this cycle an egg is released from one of your ovaries into a fallopian tube. This is called ovulation.   The egg travels down the fallopian tube towards your womb. When you make love, your partner's penis releases millions of sperm into your vagina. Some of these sperm travel up through your womb into your fallopian tubes. If there is an egg in one of these tubes, and a sperm reaches it, you can become pregnant. This is called 'conception'.   A fertilised egg gets embedded in the lining of your womb and takes 9 months to grow into a baby. As an egg can live for up to 2 days, and sperm for up to 5 days, you can become pregnant if you have made love up to 5 days before ovulation and for some time afterwards. If a sperm does not fertilise an egg, the egg is lost at the end of the menstrual cycle with the lining of your womb. This is called a 'period'.     How do natural hormones work?   Your menstrual cycle is controlled by two sex hormones made by your ovaries: one called oestrogen, the other progesterone (a progestogen). Oestrogen increases during the first half of your menstrual cycle, and makes your womb develop a thick lining, ready to receive the egg if conception happens. Progesterone comes later in the cycle and changes the lining of the womb still further to prepare it for pregnancy.   If you do not become pregnant, you make less of these hormones and this causes the lining of your womb to break down and the lining leaves your body as a period. But during pregnancy, your ovaries, and then the placenta (this attaches the growing baby to the womb and gives it food), carry on making progesterone and oestrogen to stop any more eggs being released.     How does the pill work?   A pill such as Eugynon 30 contains hormones which are like those your body produces (oestrogen and progestogen). These help stop you from getting pregnant, just as your natural hormones would stop you conceiving again when you are already pregnant.   The combined contraceptive pill protects you against getting pregnant in 3 ways:     No egg is released to be fertilised by sperm.     The fluid in the neck of your womb thickens so it is more difficult for sperm to enter it.     The lining of your womb does not thicken enough for an egg to grow in it.       How effective is the pill?   The pill is one of the most effective contraceptives apart from sterilisation.   But this can only be true when it is taken correctly.   So you must follow your doctor's instructions and take the tablets exactly as it says in the next section of this leaflet.

What you should know before taking Eugynon 30   Before you start taking Eugynon 30 your pelvic organs breasts and blood pressure should be checked by your doctor and these checks should be repeated regularly. The doctor will also make sure you are not pregnant.   If anyone in your family has had any illness caused by blood clots, or a heart attack, or a stroke at a young age, tell your doctor.   The following conditions need watching carefully while you are taking the pill:   If you have:     severe depressive states, past or present.     varicose veins.     diabetes (diabetes mellitus) or a tendency towards diabetes.     high blood pressure (hypertension).     fits (epilepsy).     the inherited form of deafness known as otosclerosis.     the disease of the nervous system called multiple sclerosis.     the inherited disease called porphyria.     calcium deficiency with cramps (tetany).     the movement disorder called Sydenham's chorea.     breast problems, past or present.     diseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardio-vascular diseases).     kidney diseases.     disturbed liver function.       you are very overweight (obese)     an intolerance of contact lenses.     systemic lupus erythematosus-SLE (inflammation of connective tissue).     asthma.     uterine fibroids (benign tumour of the womb).     gallstones.     migraine.     brown patches on the face and body (chloasma).

If any of these conditions gets worse or you have them for the first time, this may be a sign that you should stop taking Eugynon 30.   When you stop taking Eugynon 30 it may take some time for you r regular periods to return.     Taking other medicines with Eugynon 30   Some medicines may stop Eugynon 30 from working properly.   If you are taking any other medicine while you are taking Eugynon 30, be sure to tell your doctor (or dentist). Your doctor (or dentist) can tell you whether you should use extra contraceptive precautions and for how long.   Medicines which can sometimes stop Eugynon 30 from working properly are antibiotics (such as ampicillin and rifampicin); griseofulvin (which is used to treat fungal infections); phenylbutazone (which is used as an anti-inflammatory drug to treat some types of joint diseases); phenytoin, primidone, phenobarbitone and some other medicines used in people with epilepsy, and carbamazepine (which can be used to treat epilepsy or other illnesses).   If you are taking any of these medicines you might still be able to use Eugynon 30, but you will also need to use an extra contraceptive method (condoms or cap plus spermicide) while you are taking the other medicine and for 7 days after you stop taking it. If your present pack ends before these 7 days, start the next pack the next day without a break. This means taking a pill every day during your normal 7 pill-free days.   If you run two packs together you may not have a period until the end of two packs, but this is not harmful. If you do not have a period after the second pack, you must talk to your doctor before you start the next pack.   If you are taking rifampicin you will need to use another method of contraception as well as Eugynon 30. You should do this while you are taking the rifampicin and for 4 weeks after you stop.   If you are diabetic your doctor may alter the dose of medicine required to treat your diabetes.   If you are in doubt check with your doctor, pharmacist or Family Planning clinic.    Stomach upsets   Being sick or having very bad diarrhoea may stop Eugynon 30 from working properly and make it less effective. Carry on taking Eugynon 30 as usual, and also use another method of contraception, (condom or cap plus spermicide) until 7 days after you have recovered from the stomach upset. If you finish your pack before these 7 days, start the next pack the next day without a break. This means taking a pill every day during your normal 7 pill-free days. If you run two packs together you may not have a period until the end of two packs, but this is not harmful. If you do not have a period after the second pack, you must talk to your doctor before starting the next pack. If your stomach upset continues for some time, consult your doctor who may consider another form of contraception.Warnings   It has been suggested, on the basis of statistical evidence that the risk of developing various disorders of the circulation of the blood is slightly greater in women who take the combined pill than in those who do not. This can lead to, for example, deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in the leg), strokes (blood clots and haemorrhages from the blood vessels of the brain), heart attacks or pulmonary embolism (blood clots blocking the arteries of the lungs). People do not always fully recover from these disorders, and, very rarely, they are fatal. Studies suggest that these disorders occur less often with modern low-dose oral contraceptives than with older pills.   Certain conditions increase the risk of thrombosis. They include:     smoking.     obesity.     some diseases of the heart and blood vessels.     diabetes     migraine     a major operation or period of immobilisation (e.g. you are in bed after an accident or operation or you have a plaster cast on a broken leg).     if any members of your family have suffered from thromboembolic diseases (e.g. deep vein thrombosis, stroke or heart attack) at a young age.     varicose veins.     If any of these conditions apply to you before you decide to take Eugynon 30 or while you are taking Eugynon 30 you must discuss them with your doctor.   The risk of arterial thrombosis (e.g. heart attack and stroke) associated with the pill increases with age and this risk is increased by cigarette smoking. For this reason, the use of combined pills by women in the older age-group, especially those who also smoke, is discouraged.   Signs and symptoms of blood clots are given in the section ""Reasons for stopping Eugynon 30 immediately"".   The pill does give a substantial degree of protection against cancers of the ovary and the lining of the womb. An increased risk of cervical cancer in long-term users of the pill has been reported in some studies. It is uncertain whether this increased risk is caused by the pill as it could be due to the effects of sexual behaviour and other factors.   The evidence linking use of the pill and breast cancer is unclear. Some studies suggest an increased risk of breast cancer in women below the age of 35 the risk increasing the longer the pill is used. Any possible increased risk of breast cancer with combined pills is, however, likely to be small.   On rare occasions, the use of the pill has led to liver diseases such as jaundice and benign liver tumours, and, very rarely, it has been associated with some forms of malignant liver tumours (cancer) in long-term users. Liver tumours may lead to life-threatening intra-abdominal haemorrhage (bleeding in the abdomen). Therefore, if you have pain in the upper abdomen that does not soon clear up, tell your doctor. Also, if your skin becomes yellow (jaundice) you must tell your doctor.   If you think you might be pregnant, stop taking Eugynon 30 and consult your doctor immediately. Use another method of contraception such as a condom until you see your doctor.   Certain conditions may sometimes get worse during use of the pill. The diseases are those listed under ""What you should know before taking Eugynon 30"".     Reasons for stopping Eugynon 30 immediately   If you experience any of the following conditions, take no further tablets of Eugynon 30 and consult your doctor immediately. In the meantime use another method of contraception such as a condom.     migraine for the first time, or if existing migraine occurs more often than before.     unusually bad headaches or if you have headaches more often than before.       sudden changes to your eyesight, hearing, speech, sense of smell, taste or touch.     Unusual pains in your leg or unusual swelling of your arms or legs, sharp pains in your chest or sudden shortness of breath, crushing pains or feelings of heaviness in your chest, coughing for no apparent reason, dizziness or fainting, or if one side of your body suddenly becomes very weak or numb. These may be symptoms of blood clot formation or symptoms of an inflammation of veins combined with the formation of blood clots (thrombophlebitis).     your skin becomes yellow (jaundice) you develop hepatitis (inflammation of the liver) or if your whole body starts itching.     an increase in the number of fits (epileptic seizures).     a large increase in your blood pressure.     severe depression.     severe upper abdominal pains or unusual swelling of your abdomen.     definite worsening of conditions which had got worse during a previous pregnancy or while taking the pill in the past.     pregnancy.     surgery or immobilisation. You must stop Eugynon 30 six weeks before a planned major operation (e.g. stomach surgery), if you are having any surgery to the legs, or medical treatment for varicose veins. Also if you are immobilised for a long time (e.g. you are in bed after an accident or operation or you have a plaster cast on a broken leg). Your doctor will advise you when to start taking Eugynon 30 again.      How to take Eugynon 30   This pack is designed to help you remember to take your pills.      When to start   If you are new to the pill or are starting the pill again after a break, take your first Eugynon 30 tablet on the first day of bleeding of your next period. For other users, follow instructions for ""Changing from another type of oral contraceptive"", ""Starting Eugynon 30 after having a baby"" or ""Starting Eugynon 30 after a miscarriage or an abortion"".   Start with a pill marked with the correct day of the week. For instance, if your period starts on a Wednesday, start with a pill marked ""Wed"".     Taking your first pack of Eugynon 30   After taking your first pill, take one pill each day following the direction of the arrows, until you have finished all 21 pills in the pack.

A few days after you have taken the last pill from each pack you will have a period. Your periods will be regular probably lighter than before and almost always painless. The feelings that often make the last days before a period unpleasant (called premenstrual syndrome) usually disappear. You will not have to take extra contraceptive precautions during the 7-day break from taking the pill as long as you have taken your pills correctly and start the next pack on time.    Taking your next pack of Eugynon 30   Start taking your next pack of Eugynon 30 after 7 pill-free days. Each new pack will begin on the same day of the week as the one before, so it is easy to  remember when to start again.

Mini pill (progestogen-only pill)   The first Eugynon 30 tablet should be taken on the first day of the period, even if you have already taken a mini pill on that day. Return to your pharmacist any mini pills left in your old pack. Start with a pill marked with the correct day of the week. Follow the instructions as before (see ""Taking your first pack of Eugynon 30"").   By starting in this way you will haw contraceptive protection at once.       Starting Eugynon 30 after having a baby   If you have just had a baby, your doctor may advise you to start taking Eugynon 30 21 days after delivery. You do not have to wait for a period.

Very small amounts of the active ingredients of Eugynon 30 are found in breast milk. If you are breast feeding and want to take Eugynon 30, you should discuss this with your doctor. Your doctor may decide to give you the mini pill instead.     Starting Eugynon 30 after a miscarriage or an abortion   If you have just had a miscarriage or an abortion your doctor may advise you to start using Eugynon 30 immediately. Follow the instructions as before (see ""Taking your first pack of Eugynon 30"").     While you are taking Eugynon 30 What to do if you miss a period   Occasionally, you may miss a period. While this can mean you are pregnant, it is most unlikely if you have taken your pills correctly. Take your next pack as normal. If you think that you might have put yourself at risk (e.g. missed pills, taking other medicines) or if you miss a second period, see your doctor at once.     What to do if you forget to take a pill   If you forget to take a pill please follow these instructions:    If you are more than 12 hours late in taking a pill, or have missed more than one pill   Contraceptive protection may be lower, so you must use extra protection. Follow the instructions for the 7 day rule.    The bleeding you have after each pack (including the last pack) is not a true period. Your doctor relies on the date of your last true period before you get pregnant to tell you when your baby will be born. So, if you stop taking Eugynon 30 to have a baby, use another method of contraception until you have had a true period. However, it will not be harmful if you become pregnant straight away      ",

"      Dilena Tablets    What you should know about Dilena Tablets   Before you start to take this medicine please read this leaflet carefully. If you have any questions or worries, ask your doctor or pharmacist.     What is in your medicine?   The name of your medicine is Dilena.   Each strip contains eleven white tablets and ten blue tablets. Both the white tablets and the blue tablets contain 2 mg oestradiol valerate (an oestrogen). The blue tablets also contain 10 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (a progestogen).    Other ingredients:   Dilena tablets also contain the following inactive ingredients: Lactose, corn starch, gelatine, talc and magnesium stearate. The blue tablets also contain polyvinylpyrrolidone K25 and indigo carmine (E132).   Each strip contains eleven white tablets and ten blue tablets.   Each carton contains either 1 or 3 foil strips of 21 tablets.   Dilena belongs to a group of medicines used in Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT).    Authorisation holder:   The product licence for Dilena is held by: Organon Laboratories Ltd, Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge, CB4 4FL.    Dilena is manufactured by:   Orion Pharmaceutica, PO Box 65 SF-02101, Espoo, Finland.     What this medicine is used for   Dilena is used to relieve the symptoms of the menopause and prevent osteoporosis after the menopause. It can also relieve these symptoms of the menopause in women who have had their ovaries removed.     How this medicine works   Dilena contains an oestrogen (oestradiol valerate) and a progestogen (medroxyprogesterone acetate). Oestrogens are mainly produced by the ovaries. They are necessary for the normal sexual development of women and to regulate the menstrual cycle during the child bearing years. When women get older the ovaries gradually produce less oestrogen. The period in which this happens (usually around the age of 50) is called the climacteric or menopause. If the ovaries are removed surgically (oopherectomy) before the menopause, the decrease in oestrogen production occurs very abruptly. Shortage of oestrogen leads to complaints such as hot flushes and night sweating. The vaginal wall may become thin and dry, so sexual intercourse may be painful. Vaginal infections can also occur. Some women feel depressed and lose their sex drive. These complaints can often be relieved by using medicines containing oestrogen such as Dilena.   The blue tablets contain a progestogen to give you a regular monthly bleed.   The shortage of oestrogen may cause thinning of bones (osteoporosis). Other factors that contribute to osteoporosis are early menopause, family history of osteoporosis, recent corticosteroid therapy, a small body frame, thinness and cigarette smoking. Over the years the bones become brittle and break easily. Dilena can also prevent osteoporosis.     When not to take Dilena   Dilena should not be taken by women who are pregnant.     Do you have any disorders of the heart or the blood circulation?     Have you ever had a blood clot, or phlebitis?     Do you suffer from liver or kidney disease?     Are you suffering from cancer of the breast or endometrium?     Do you suffer from endometriosis?     Do you suffer from a rare liver disorder such as Rotor syndrome or Dubin-Johnson syndrome?     Do you suffer from herpes developed during pregnancy (gestational herpes)?     Have you had jaundice or loss of hearing during pregnancy?     Do you suffer from vaginal bleeding?     Do you suffer from diabetes?     If the answer is YES to any of these questions D0 NOT take the medicine, see your doctor.     Precautions and possible problems   While you are taking Dilena it is important to see your doctor every 6-12 months for a check up. Normally you will have a monthly period while taking Dilena. If you notice any unusual vaginal bleeding tell your doctor at once.     Interactions   Other medicines may influence the effects of Dilena or vice versa. Tell your doctor if you are taking other medicines.   Dilena may decrease the effect of the following medicines:     drugs used to treat high blood pressure (antihypertensives) drugs used to treat diabetes (antidiabetics) drugs used to treat blood clots (oral anticoagulants)     Similarly the following drugs may decrease the effect of Dilena:     Drugs sometimes used to treat sleeplessness or epilepsy (barbiturates) Antibiotics such as ampicillin, rifampicin and tetracyclines Drugs used to treat epilepsy (hydantoin)       Other ingredients in Dilena   Dilena contains lactose. If you are allergic to lactose or any other ingredient in this medicine, ask you doctor before taking it.

Take one white tablet every day on days 1-11 then take a blue tablet every day on days 12-21. Stop tablet taking for the next 7 days. You should start bleeding during this week. Some women may not bleed or only bleed every few months.   After 7 tablet-free days start you r next pack of Dilena tablets.    If you still have periods start taking the tablets on the 5th day of your period.    At the top of the foil strip there are circles marked with the days of the week.

"     Cyclo-Progynova 1 mg must also be stopped at once if you become pregnant, or it you develop jaundice, or your doctor finds your blood-pressure to be significantly raised or if you notice an increase in epileptic seizures.   If you have fibroids of the womb these may grow during treatment. You should stop taking Cyclo-Progynova 1 mg if your doctor finds this has happened.   Ask your doctor for advice on whether you should stop taking the tablets if you are confined to bed or have an accident or illness, or you need an operation.    What to do if ...     ... You are taking other medicines at the same time as Cyclo-Progynova 1 mg.      Some drugs e. g. antibiotics and antiepileptics may reduce the effectiveness of Cyclo-Progynova 1 mg.     If you have to take other medicines regularly, you should inform your doctor.     If you are diabetic your doctor may alter the dose of medicine required to treat your diabetes.     Oral contraceptives should not be used. Consult your doctor for contraceptive advice.     If in doubt about any medicines you are taking, ask your doctor      How to take Cyclo-Progynova 1 mg   About the pack:   The pack of Cyclo-Progynova 1 mg is designed to help you remember to take your medicine. To use it you must first know the day of the week on which you will take the first tablet. If you are still having periods, take the first tablet on the fifth day of your period, whether the period has finished or not. If your periods have become infrequent or have stopped altogether, your doctor may have advised you to start Cyclo-Progynova 1 mg immediately. In addition to the memo-pack (which contains the tablets), the outer carton contains a self--adhesive blue sticker showing the days of the week. Peel the circular sticker off its backing and stick it in the centre of the memo-pack so that the day on which you start taking the tablets is directly underneath the red segment marked ""Start"".    For instance, it you are to start the tablets on a   Wednesday, then stick a ""Wed"" directly underneath the red segment marked ""Start"""". You can now see on which day you have to take each tablet. Simply take one tablet each day, following the directions of the arrows, until the pack is empty. This means that you will be taking one beige tablet for the first 11 days and then one pale brown tablet daily for the following 10 days. If, at any time, you are in doubt whether you have taken your tablet, a glance at the appropriate day on the memo-pack will tell you.   When you have finished your first pack, you must leave a tablet-tree interval of seven days (unless your doctor decides otherwise). During this week, bleeding similar to a period should occur.   Start your next pack of Cyclo-Progynova 1 mg immediately after this seven-day break, whether the bleeding has stopped or not. You will in fact start on the same day as you started the previous pack, and the same will be true for each successive pack.   It is best to take your tablet at the same time each day, preferably after a meal. The tablet should not be chewed or sucked, but swallowed whole.    What to do it . . . .. . you forget to take a tablet     Take it as soon as possible, and take the next one at your normal time.     But it you are more than   twelve hours   late, leave the forgotten tablet in the pack. Continue to take the remaining tablets at the usual time on the right days.      ... you take too many tablets at once.      There have been no reports of ill-effects from overdosage. You should consult your doctor who will be able to advise you what action, if any, is necessary.       ...your bleeding pattern seems different     If you are still menstruating, you will probably have bleeding regularly, 2-3 days after finishing  each pack of Cyclo-Progynova 1 mg. it you miss a period, the possibility of pregnancy should be investigated. Ask your doctor what to do.     If you have finished your periods, Cyclo-Progynova 1 mg will probably cause you to bleed again after the end of each pack, but may not always do so.     If bleeding occurs during the three weeks in which you are taking the tablets, let your doctor know. It is not necessary to stop tablet-taking unless your doctor says so.     Just as with normal periods, the amount of bleeding with Cyclo-Progynova 1 mg varies from woman to woman. Usually the bleeding is not unduly heavy, and it may even be rather scanty, but this is not important as tar as the treatment is concerned. It you have recently had very light, short periods, you may have rather heavier bleedings with Cyclo-Progynova 1 mg.     Side-effects   During the first few months of treatment you may experience some vaginal bleeding at unexpected times (breakthrough bleeding and spotting) and some breast tenderness or enlargement. These symptoms are usually temporary and normally disappear with continued treatment. It they don’t, contact your doctor.   The following symptoms, which may or may not have been caused by Cyclo-Progynova 1 mg, have been reported: indigestion, nausea, vomiting, bloated stomach, increased appetite, Increased or reduced weight, leg pains, fluid retention, palpitations, dizziness, anxiety, headaches, depressive moods, rashes, altered sexual interest.   Tell your doctor if you have any of these symptoms, or, indeed, any other symptoms, while you are taking Cyclo-Progynova 1 mg.   It is best to take your tablet at the same time each day, preferably after a meal. The tablet should not be chewed or sucked, but swallowed whole.

"    PATIENT INFORMATION LEAFLET   PLEASE READ THIS LEAFLET CAREFULLY BEFORE USING    KOGENATE 250    What does KOGENATE contain?   KOGENATE is a freeze-dried powder which contains 250 International Units (IU) of Factor VIII (rDNA) (bhk).   It contains also human albumin, glycine, calcium chloride and 18 mg of sodium chloride. KOGENATE must be dissolved in the Water for Injections supplied before it is administered.   This box contains one 10 ml vial of freeze-dried KOGENATE powder.   You should have received another box connected to this box which contains:   One 10 ml vial containing 2.5 ml of Water for Injections.   Two sterile alcohol swabs for single use.      A blister pack containing:    One plastic syringe.   One venepuncture set.   One filter needle.   One transfer device.   The vial will appear to be only partially full but this is normal and does not mean that it contains the wrong amount of powder.   KOGENATE 250 contains Factor VlIl and is to be used to stop and/or prevent the bleeding you get with haemophilia A.   The Factor VlIl in KOGENATE is made by the process of genetic engineering as indicated by the initials (rDNA) (bhk) used above.     Product Licence/Authorisation Holder:   Manufacturer:     Bayer plc Bayer House Strawberry Hill Newbury Berkshire RG13 1JA Bayer AG Leverkusen Germany    Why have I been prescribed KOGENATE by my doctor?   KOGENATE has been prescribed by your doctor to stop and/or prevent the bleeding you might get with haemophilia A.   Haemophilia A is a disease which results because your body does not produce enough Factor VlIl.  Factor VlIl is a component in the blood which helps it to clot when you are bleeding.  If the level of Factor VlIl is low in your blood, your body will have difficulty in stopping bleeding.   You can use KOGENATE if you have never been treated for haemophilia before, or if you have previously been treated for haemophilia and have no antibodies to Factor VlIl (inhibitors) which would neutralise Factor VlIl in your blood.   If you have been using KOGENATE and you develop Factor VlIl inhibitors, treatment may be continued as long as you still respond to KOGENATE and the inhibitors in your blood remain below a certain level (10 Bethesda Units).  Speak to your doctor if you would like further information about this.   This product does not contain von Willebrand Factor, so it cannot be used in von Willebrand’s disease.     When should I not use KOGENATE 250?   Do not use KOGENATE if you are allergic to any of the ingredients.  If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor.   If you know that you are allergic to mouse or hamster protein, KOGENATE should not be used.  Consult your doctor if you are unsure about this.  Usually, if you are allergic to KOGENATE, a reaction will occur upon first use of the product.  Allergic reactions can occur at the injection site such as a burning sensation, temporary redness or a rash or you may experience nausea, dizziness or a tight chest.     What special precautions should I take?   If you think that you are having an allergic reaction to KOGENATE, stop administering the product immediately and seek medical advice.  Speak to your doctor regularly about your treatment.  He/she may wish to carry out tests to ensure that your current dose of KOGENATE is sufficient to reach and maintain adequate Factor VlIl levels.   If your bleeding is not being controlled with KOGENATE, consult your doctor immediately.  You may have developed Factor VlIl inhibitors and your doctor may wish to carry out tests to confirm this.  Factor VlIl inhibitors are antibodies in the blood which act against the Factor VlIl you are using.  This makes the Factor VlIl less effective in controlling bleeding.   If you are pregnant, planning a family or are breast-feeding, tell your doctor before using this product.  If you have informed your doctor already, follow his/her instructions carefully.   There is no evidence that Factor VlIl may impair your ability to drive or to use machines.     How much KOGENATE 250 should I use?   The amount of KOGENATE you use and how often you use it depends on many factors such as your weight, the severity of your haemophilia, the site and extent of bleeding, the amount of Factor VlIl inhibitors that you may have and the Factor VIII level required.   Your doctor will calculate the dose of KOGENATE and the frequency you should use it to get the necessary level of Factor VlIl activity in your blood.  He will do this according to   your   particular needs using the formulae below.   I)To determine the dose required for a given response:   Required IU = body weight (kg) x desired Factor VlIl rise (% of normal) x 0 5   II)To determine the response expected from a given dose:      Expected Factor VlIl rise (% of normal) = 2 x administered IU body weight (kg)   If you are infusing KOGENATE to stop a bleeding episode, the amount of KOGENATE you will need depends on the site and extent of your bleeding.  For example, if you are suffering a minor haemorrhage, such as bleeding into a joint, the plasma level of Factor VlIl activity should not fall below 30 % of normal for at least one day.  If your bleeding is more severe or you need an operation, the dose of KOGENATE and time of usage will increase.   If you are using KOGENATE to prevent bleeding (PROPHYLAXIS), your doctor will calculate the dose for you.  This will usually be in the range of 10 to 50 IU of KOGENATE per kg of body weight administered at intervals of 2 to 3 days.  However, in some cases, especially younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.   If you have a large number of Factor VlIl inhibitors, the dose of KOGENATE you are given by your doctor will be high to maintain the correct Factor VlIl activity in your blood.  If this dose does not control your bleeding your doctor may consider the use of an additional product (activated) prothrombin complex concentrate.  Speak to your doctor if you would like further information about this.    How do I administer KOGENATE 250?   If you have been prescribed KOGENATE to use at home, your doctor will have ensured that you know how to administer it.    If you are in any doubt about using KOGENATE, go back to your doctor for further advice and training before attempting to administer your treatment.    Follow the directions given by your doctor closely and use the instructions below as a guide:     Wash your hands thoroughly using soap and warm water.     Without opening either vial, warm the KOGENATE powder and the Water for Injections to room temperature.  This can be done by taking the vials from the fridge and allowing them to stand in a room for approximately one hour or, if needed to treat a bleed sooner, the vials can be warmed by holding them in your hands.             DO NOT leave the vials by a direct source of heat such as a radiator or fire in order to warm them quickly and try not to shake the vials KOGENATE must never be heated to more than 37ºC (body temperature)     Carefully remove the protective caps from both vials and clean each of the rubber stoppers with the sterile swabs supplied (diagram   A  )    IMPORTANT:   Use a fresh swab for each stopper.   An antiseptic spray may also be used and this can be purchased from your local pharmacist (chemist).     Stand the transfer device on a clean surface   making sure that the corrugated edge of the sleeve is facing upward.   (diagram   B  ).     Turn the vial containing Water for Injections upside down and mount it onto the transfer device (diagram   C  ).  Press them together firmly and then immediately place the combined Water for Injections vial and transfer device on top of the vial containing the KOGENATE powder.  Press into place firmly and then hold the three components in place until all the water has been drawn into the vial containing powder (diagram   D  ).     Remove the water vial and transfer device and dispose of them carefully Ask your doctor how.     Swirl the powder vial gently until all of the KOGENATE powder is dissolved and you have a clear solution (diagram   E  ).  Do not shake the vial vigorously.      Make sure that all of the powder has dissolved before going on to the next step    IMPORTANT Once the powder is dissolved in water, the solution must be used within four hours.         When all of the powder has dissolved, attach the filter needle to a syringe (diagram   F  ) and insert the needle after swabbing the stopper straight through the top of the vial into the dissolved KOGENATE by puncturing through the stopper.     Hold the vial upside down above the needle and syringe and draw out the plunger slowly and smoothly to fill the syringe (diagram   G  ).  Then, holding the plunger in place, remove the syringe from the filter needle.  (The filter needle should remain attached to the vial).     Attach a venepuncture set to the syringe (diagram   H  ).     Apply a tourniquet as previously demonstrated by your doctor or nurse.     Locate the point of injection and clean it with a sterile swab (not supplied).     Insert the solution into the tube of the venepuncture set by pressing the plunger of the syringe until the tube is approximately two-thirds full.     Puncture the vein and secure the venepuncture set in place with a plaster.  Make sure that no blood enters the syringe.     Remove the tourniquet.     Inject the solution slowly into the vein making sure that the needle remains in place.  The solution should be injected at a speed of 1-2 ml per minute.     If another vial of KOGENATE solution needs to be administered once the initial injection is complete, the syringe should be left connected to the venepuncture set.   Prepare a new vial as before (steps 1 to 9) and fill a new syringe. When you are ready to inject the solution, remove the old syringe from the venepuncture set and continue as before     If no further dose is required, remove the venepuncture set and syringe and hold a swab firmly over the injection site for about two minutes with the arm outstretched and held upward.  Finally, apply a small pressure dressing to the wound and discard any unused solution.     Dispose of the vials and venepuncture kit carefully, as directed by your doctor.  Do not dispose of them with your normal rubbish.    REMEMBER:If you have any doubt about administering KOGENATE correctly, consult your doctor for further advice.     DO NOT EXCEED THE PRESCRIBED DOSE.     If you inject more than the prescribed dose, or in the event of an overdose, seek medical advice and, if possible, take your KOGENATE and its packaging with you.      What should I do if I forget to use my KOGENATE?   Inject your normal dose as soon as you remember and then continue as prescribed by your doctor.     What side-effects may I experience?   A number of rarely reported side-effects have been observed with KOGENATE.  These include reactions at the injection site such as a burning sensation, temporary redness and rash.  Also, tightness of the chest, dizziness and nausea have been reported and mildly reduced blood pressure, which may make you feel faint upon standing.  If you experience any of these side-effects, consult your doctor for advice.   The formation of inhibitors (neutralising antibodies) to Factor VIII is a well-known, but rare complication in the management of haemophilia A.  This occurs mainly in patients who were previously untreated before receiving KOGENATE.  Therefore, you should inform your doctor if you were untreated prior to receiving KOGENATE, as he/she may wish to carefully monitor your progress.    IF YOU EXPERIENCE ANY OTHER UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS, TELL YOUR DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY.      How should I store my KOGENATE 250?   KOGENATE powder should be stored in a refrigerator (2 to 8ºC) until the expiry date which is shown on the packaging.   In exceptional cases, KOGENATE powder may be removed from the fridge and kept at room temperature (up to 25ºC) for a maximum period of three months as long as it is kept in the original packaging.  If you need to take your medicine from the fridge for a prolonged period of time, you must write the date of the end of the three month period on the space provided on the vial and/or the box immediately.   Do not refrigerate the KOGENATE solution alter it has been made up Preferably, the solution should be used immediately following preparation.  However, if this is not possible the prepared solution should be used within   four   hours    THIS PRODUCT IS FOR SINGLE USE ONLY.  ANY UNUSED SOLUTION MUST BE DISCARDED.    Do not use KOGENATE alter the expiry date which is marked on the label of each vial and on the outer cartons.   If you find that you have any KOGENATE after its expiry date, return it to your local pharmacist who will dispose of it properly.

"    Special Advice Children   There is no experience of use in children. Therefore, it should not be used in children.    Elderly   The same dosage should be used as for Adults.     Pregnancy   Tell your doctor BEFORE you are given Innohep if you are pregnant, might be pregnant or you are breast feeding.     What medical checks will you have?   Most people receiving Innohep do not have regular tests to check levels of tinzaparin sodium in their blood since it is not necessary to monitor this treatment.   If you have blood tests for other reasons, tell your doctor or nurse that you are receiving Innohep. It could affect the results. Do not miss appointments with your doctor.    Injecting Innohep   Innohep is usually administered by a health Care professional by injection under the skin. It is usually given once a day for at least 6 days depending on your own response to the medicine. The dose given will depend upon your weight.      What if you are given too much Innohep?   This may result in bleeding which can be reversed by giving an injection of protamine sulphate. This will usually be given by a health care professional.     Does Innohep have side effects?   Innohep can sometimes have side effects but these are rare.   These include: skin rashes, bruising at the injection site and allergic reactions such as hot flushes, difficulty in breathing skin itching and redness. The most serious is blood in your urine or bowel motions or bleeding from your nose which is due to a decrease of cells in your blood. Like other agents which stop the blood from clotting, it also increases the incidence of bleeding. Frequently there is an increase in an enzyme level in your blood (transaminase) but this does not usually mean that you have to stop your treatment.    If you feel unwell or notice anything unusual or which you do not understand, tell your doctor as soon as possible.     Remember, this treatment is for you. Only a doctor can prescribe it for you. Do not let other people use your medicine.      Storing Innohep   Innohep should be stored at room temperature in a safe place out of the reach of children.   Once opened, use within 14 days.   Do not use after the expiry date given on the label.    Date Leaflet Last Revised: November 1995    Registered Trade Mark      ",

"    INFORMATION FOR THE PATIENT    WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT HUMEGON    Before this medicine is given to you please read this page carefully. On the back of this leaflet you will find more information about Humegon as well as some general advice on using medicines.     If you have any questions or worries, ask your doctor or pharmacist.      What's in this medicine   Active substance: HMG, human menopausal gonadotrophins, 75 or 150 international units per ampoule.     How this medicine works and what it is used for   The action of Humegon is similar to that of two different, natural hormones, follicle-stimulating hormone {FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). In women these hormones are needed to ripen the egg cell: in men they are needed in the production of sperm. Humegon is used in fertility disorders that are caused by a shortage of these hormones. It is also used in in-vitro (test tube) fertilization. On the back of this leaflet you will find more information about the action and use of Humegon.     When not to use this medicine   This medicine should not be given to patients with tumours of the ovaries, testes or pituitary gland.     Precautions and possible problems   There are no special precautions for use in men.    Close supervision   of female patients is extremely important. Usually blood sampling and ultrasound are performed daily. The results of these tests allow the doctor to choose the proper dose from day to day. This is very important since too high a dose may lead to overstimulation of the ovaries. This may be noticed as pain in the abdomen. Should you be troubled with pain in the abdomen, contact your doctor without delay.    Pregnancy.   If treatment with Humegon results in pregnancy, there is a high chance of having twins or multiplets. There is also more chance of a miscarriage.     Using this medicine properly Humegon should only be given by a doctor or nurse    How much  . The dose is chosen by the doctor.   In female patients injections are given daily or sometimes every second day for about 10 days.   In male patients injections are given several times a week for at least 10-12 weeks.    How to administer   The powder in one ampoule should first be dissolved in the fluid in the other ampoule. The injections should be given in muscle tissue (for instance in the buttock, upper leg or upper arm).     Side effects this medicine may have   In rare cases skin rash may occur. No other side-effects are expected.     How to store this medicine   Keep the ampoules in the original package in a safe place where children cannot reach them. The storage conditions and the date that they should be used by are given on the pack. If not, consult your pharmacist or doctor.     MORE ABOUT HUMEGON   The action of Humegon is similar to that of two different, natural hormones, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). In both men and women these hormones are produced in the pituitary gland. Together FSH and LH control the action of the sexual glands (ovaries in women and testes in men).   In women FSH and LH ensure the monthly ripening of the follicle, a tiny cavity in which the egg cell develops. LH is also needed for ovulation, the release of the egg cell. If the body itself does not produce enough FSH and LH, infertility may be the result. In these cases Humegon can be used to make up the shortage. To determine the right dosage a daily check is necessary. The amount of oestrogens (female hormones) in blood or urine is measured and the follicle size is determined by means of ultrasound. When the follicle is big enough, another hormone (for instance Pregnyl) is given. This is a strong LH preparation which causes ovulation. In spite of the careful monitoring more than one egg cell is released. This increases the chance of twins or multiplets.   In men very high LH activity is necessary for the production of sperm cells. Therefore extra Pregnyl injections are usually given as well as Humegon. Because the development of sperm cells takes about 74 days, treatment should be continued for at least 10 to 12 weeks before any improvement can be expected.   Infertility can also be the result of causes other than a shortage of FSH and LH. In these cases artificial techniques are sometimes used, for instance test-tube fertilization (in-vitro fertilization). For this technique several egg cells are needed and Humegon is used to cause a number of egg cells to develop.     IMPORTANT POINTS     Humegon has been prescribed only for your current medical problem. Do not use it for other medical problems.     Do not allow other people to use your medicines and do not use medicines meant for other people.     Tell any doctor treating you what medicines you are taking. Always carry a medical information card stating which medicines you are using. This can be very important if you are involved in an accident.     Return unused medicines to the pharmacist.     Make sure that other people who live with or who look after you read this information.

It will not stop an asthma attack once it has started.     BEFORE USING YOUR MEDICINE   Tell your doctor before you start taking   ZADITEN   elixir if the answer to any of the following questions is yes:     Do you suspect that you have had an allergic reaction to   ZADITEN   previously, or been upset by any of the ingredients it contains (listed in ""What's in your Medicine"")?

Wash your hands after applying the Cream unless you have treated psoriasis on your hands.     Try not to transfer the Cream from the areas you have treated to other areas of your body, especially your face         What should I do if I forget to use the Cream?     If you forget to use the Cream at the right time, use it as soon as you remember. Then go on as before.      After Using The Cream     Do not worry if the Cream irritates your skin for a short while after you have applied it. Try not to scratch the area.

If your psoriasis gets worse, or if you have any unexpected problems,   stop   using the Cream and see your doctor as soon as possible.     Redness or skin irritation on your face or around your mouth may be caused by accidentally getting the Cream on your face. If this occurs, take extra care to wash your hands well after applying the Cream.

Profasi 10000 IU is manufactured by:   Laboratoires Serono SA, Zone Industrielle de L’Ouriettaz,  1170 Aubonne, Switzerland.     Why Profasi?   Profasi contains a hormone which is found naturally in the body. It is used to treat infertility caused by certain conditions in both men and women, which are as follows:     Women who are not producing eggs. Profasi is given after treatment with other medicines to bring about ovulation (the production of eggs).     Women undergoing an assisted conception technique eg in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment. Other medicines are given first to produce follicles. Profasi is used to ripen (mature) these follicles.     Used with another medicine in men suffering from a condition called hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism which may make them infertile. Profasi is used to stimulate and maintain the production of sperm .     Used in men and boys with a condition called cryptorchidism. Profasi stimulates a group of cells which leads to the descent of the testes.     Your doctor can explain why Profasi has been given to you.     Why should you not be given Profasi   Although Profasi can be used in most people with the conditions stated above, there are certain people who should not be given the medicine. These people are listed below:     Women in which the treatment would not be expected to work eg women with blocked or damaged tubes (unless you are having IVF treatment).     Men or women suffering from hormonal disorders (thyroid, adrenals or prolactin) which have not been treated.      Women who have suffered from ovarian hyper- | stimulation syndrome (more details are given | later in the leaflet).     Speak to your doctor if you think that you are one of the people who should not be given Profasi.     Important information you should know about Profasi   Profasi may cause pain and soreness at the injection site.    Women:   Occasionally, some people have a reaction to the treatment that you have been given/are taking and develop a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation. This is when the ovaries overreact to the treatment. This condition can cause various symptoms to occur. The most common is abdominal (stomach) pain. Rarely, the condition can be severe and you may need to be in hospital. To stop this ! condition developing or reduce the chances of it happening, it is important that it is your doctor who ! decides whether or not you should take the Profasi. h is, therefore, recommended that you see your doctor shortly before you are due to start the treatment with Profasi, so that he can check your ovarian response. It is important that if you have significant abdominal (stomach) pain or discomfort, you must NOT give yourself the injection of Profasi and that you speak to your doctor or nurse as soon as possible. The doctor will then decide whether or not to continue the treatment cycle. If you have to stop treatment, you S will be asked not to have sexual intercourse and usually you will have to rest.   Sometimes, multiple pregnancies occur following treatment. The majority of these are twins. It is very rare to have a large number of babies at the same time due to the treatment with Profasi.   Pregnancy loss (miscarriage) in women undergoing assisted conception techniques is higher than normal but much the same as rates found in women with other fertility problems.   The risk of the baby having any abnormalities is not ! increased by taking Profasi.   This medicine should not be used by girls or the elderly.    Men/boys:   In men, high doses of Profasi could lead to a condition called oedema. This is when the body retains water. The most usual signs are swollen feet and hands. If this occurs, the amount of Profasi that you are given will probably be reduced.   In men or boys, the medicine may bring about puberty-like symptoms. If this happens at an early age, the treatment will probably be stopped.     How will Profasi be given to you?   Profasi is given by injection either under the skin or into a muscle.   Profasi is usually given by a doctor or a nurse although some patients are trained to give the injection themselves. If you are injecting yourself you should have been given instructions on this, ask your doctor or nurse if you are at all unsure about anything.   The amount of Profasi you will be given will depend, on your condition.     Women    Women who are not producing eggsWomen who are not producing    You will be given up to 10000 IU of Profasi after treatment with another medicine used to stimulate the development of the egg as part of a planned scheme.      Women undergoing assisted conception techniques:      You will be given up to 10000 IU of Profasi after treatment with other medicines as part of a planned I scheme. Egg retrieval is carried out 34 36 hours after being given Profasi. Your doctor will explain this . procedure to you.        Men    Hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism   You will be given Profasi twice a week usually at a dose of 2000 IU although the dose can vary. Sometimes it is necessary to add in treatment with another medicine. This treatment plan may carry on for a few months.   Your doctor may want to test your blood or sperm during this time.     Cryptorchidism   Profasi will be given to you every day for several weeks, usually at a dose of 500-1000 IU although this may vary.   Your doctor will be able to explain more about your particular treatment.      Can Profasi cause side effects?   Any medicines can cause side-effects.

"    LOESTRIN PATIENT INFORMATION LEAFLET INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF 21-TABLET PACKS   This leaflet is designed to help you use correctly Parke-Davis 21-tablet combined oral contraceptive (combination of two hormones) and to answer many of the questions that you may have about the pill. It cannot tell you everything about the pill because this requires explanation by your doctor as much of it may not apply to your particular circumstances.   The pill has been extensively researched, and vast experience has confirmed that it can be safely used by the majority of women. Nevertheless, it is important to recognise that, however wide medical experience of a product becomes, its complete safety in all users can never be guaranteed, since every person is unique, and that with the pill, or with any other medicinal product, some risk must be accepted. The pill is available to you only on prescription because your doctor’s professional knowledge and judgment are required to supervise its use. Therefore, the leaflet is not intended to take the place of his information and instructions to you, but to reinforce them. Ask him to explain anything that you do not understand, and do not hesitate to consult him if you have any doubts or anxieties about your use of the pill or the effect it may be having on you.    THE BENEFITS OF COMBINED ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES   Pills of this type are highly effective reversible forms of contraception. In addition, they have advantages not provided by other methods. Generally, irregular periods are replaced by regular bleeding, and heavy periods by lighter bleeding. Painful periods are in most cases abolished. The symptoms that often make the last few days before a period so unpleasant a part of every month (known as the premenstnual syndrome) are commonly eliminated. Finally, because of the combined pill’s outstanding reliability, all the risks that result from failure of contraception - in other words from pregnancy - are much less than with other methods.     HOW PREGNANCY IS PREVENTED   From the beginning of sexual maturity until the change of life, the ovaries normally release an egg cell (ovulate) every month. If it is fertilized by a man’s sperm, it becomes embedded in the womb and begins to grow. From then on, the ovaries produce increased amounts of hormone to maintain the pregnancy and to prevent further egg cells from developing. Thus, in pregnancy, development of egg cells is inhibited by the body’s own hormones.   Combined oral contraceptives contain similar hormones, and therefore ad in a similar way, so that normally when an oral contraceptive is taken no egg cells are released for fertilization. In addition, the fluid present in the neck of the womb remains thick, so that it is more difficult for sperms to enter the womb. Also, the lining of the womb is not prepared sufficiently for a fertilised egg to grow in it. A combined oral contraceptive thus offers protection against pregnancy in several ways.     BEFORE STARTING THE PILL   There are certain medical conditions that nub out the use of this type of pill, which are listed later under ‘Contra-indications’. There are certain other conditions that, while not ruling out the pill, indicate the need for careful consideration before a decision is taken to use the pill, and which require supervision during its use. These conditions are referred to under ‘Warnings and Precautions’. Your doctor will have considered whether or not any of the conditions referred to under those headings apply to you, but before you start taking the pill, d you are in any doubt, discuss the matter with him again.     HOW TO TAKE THE PILL About the pack   This memo-pack has been specially designed to help your memory; in fact, it does the counting for you. Each pill is placed in a section marked with the day of the week on which it should be taken. If, at any time, you are in doubt whether you have taken your pill, a glance at the appropriate day on the memo-pack will tell you.    Taking your first course   If you are having as usual, count the first day of bleeding of your next period as day 1, and take your first pill on that day. Choose a pill marked with the correct day of the week. One Loestrin tablet should be taken daily for three weeks. Following the direction of the arrows, take a pill each day until the pack is empty.      2   If you have just had a baby, it is usual to wait until your first period before starting the pill, but you should realise that it is possible to get pregnant before the first period, and use some other form of contraception in the meantime. If you are breastfeeding, or want to start the pill earlier, you should get your doctor’s advice.   After a miscarriage or abortion within the first twelve weeks of pregnancy, oral contraceptives can normally be started at once.   If you are changing from another oral contraceptive, leave whatever break is appropriate between courses of that contraceptive before starting the new one.   If the starting day was not the first day of menstrual bleeding, you should use an additional contraceptive for the first 7 days of the first pack in addition to taking the tablets. Suitable methods are sheaths. cap plus spermicide, and intra-uterine devices. The rhythm, temperature and cervical-mucus methods cannot be used.   Additional precautions are not needed subsequently. except when special circumstances reduce the reliability of the pill, as described under ‘Reduced protection’. Except in those circumstances, the protection provided by the pill is continuous, and this includes the weeks between the courses of pill when you are taking no tablets.    Subsequent courses   Allow an interval of one tablet-free week before commencing the second and subsequent courses of tablets. Each new course of tablets is always started on the same day of the week.      IRREGULAR BLEEDING  If bleeding is missed   If, as may occasionally happen, you should have no bleeding at all in the seven days after a course of pills, and you have taken the tablets correctly, it is very unlikely that you are pregnant, but the possibility should be ruled out by your doctor before you start a new course of pills.    If bleeding starts while you are taking tablets   If bleeding occurs during the three weeks in which you are taking the pills do not stop taking them. The bleeding should stop in a day or two. However, if the bleeding is troublesome, very heavy, prolonged or recurrent, you should consult your doctor. Bleeding while the pills are being taken does not mean that the pill does not suit you, nor does it necessarily mean that contraceptive protection is lost (but see ‘Interaction with other medicines’). If bleeding does occur during pill-taking, it is usually only in the first two or three months, while your body is adjusting itself to the pill.      REDUCED PROTECTION If you forget to take your pill   If you forget to take a pill at the usual time, it must be taken as soon as possible and the next tablet taken at the normal time. If the delay exceeds twelve hours, additional contraception (which must be a sheath, or cap and spermicide) should be used for the next seven days, while the next seven tablets are being taken; then continue as usual according to instructions. If your period fails to occur, consult your doctor immediately before starting your next course. If pills have been missed during the last seven days of the pack, there should be no break before the next pack is started.    If you have a stomach upset   Vomiting and diarrhoea may interfere with absorption of the pill and reduce its contraceptive effect. If you do get such a stomach upset, continue to take the pills, but you should use another method of contraception, which must be a sheath or cap plus spermicide, during and for seven days after the upset. If those seven days overrun the end of the pack, the next pack should be started without a break.     Interaction with other medicines   Some medicines may reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives when taken at the same time. They include certain sedatives, antibiotics and anti-epileptic drugs. Suspicion that the reliability of an oral contraceptive is reduced in this way is sometimes raised by occurrence of irregular bleeding. If you are taking any medicines at all while you are also taking an oral contraceptive, be sure to tell your doctor, who can advise you whether or not you should take additional contraceptive precautions.   By law, certain information must appear in any leaflet of this kind, and must be kept separate from the rest of the contents. That information comprises the remainder of this leaflet.      3 CONTRA-INDICATIONS   You should not take a combined oral contraceptive if you have any of the following: clots in the blood vessels (thrombotic disorders), or a history of these conditions: abnormal red blood cells (sickle-cell anaemia); high blood fats (disorders of lipid metabolism) and other conditions in which there is known or suspected to be a much increased risk of thrombosis (eg severe forms of the condition referred to in paragraph 2 of ‘Warnings’ or the presence of a number of these conditions); a possible pregnancy; cancer of the breasts or of the lining of the womb (mammary or endometrial carcinoma) or a history of these conditions; abnormal vaginal bleeding of unknown cause; a history during pregnancy of (1) itching of the whole body (pruritus of pregnancy), (2) shingles (herpes) of pregnancy, (3) inherited deafness (otosclerosis), or (4) jaundice not explained by infections, poisons or obstruction of the flow of bile (idiopathic jaundice of pregnancy); certain other types of jaundice (Dubin-Johnson or Rotor syndromes); any short-term or severe long-term liver disease.     WARNINGS   There is a general opinion, based on statistical evidence, that users of combined oral contraceptives experience more often than non-users various disorders of the circulation of blood, including strokes (blood clots in and haemorrhages from the blood-vessels of the brain), heart attacks (coronary thromboses), and blood clots obstructing the arteries of the lungs (pulmonary emboli). There may not be a full recovery from such disorders and it should be realized that in a few cases they are fatal. How often these disorders occur in users of modem contraceptives is not known, but there are reasons for suggesting that they may occur less often than with older pills containing more oestrogen.   Certain conditions carry some risk of thrombosis. They include smoking, obesity, varicose veins, some diseases of the heart and blood vessels, diabetes and migraine. If any of these conditions apply to you, the advisability of your taking a combined oral contraceptive should be discussed with your doctor before you decide to take the pill. The risk of arterial thrombosis (eg heart attack and stroke) associated with combined oral contraceptives increases with age, and this risk is aggravated by cigarette smoking. For this reason, the use of combined oral contraceptives by women in the older age group, especially those who are cigarette smokers, is to be discouraged.   The possibility cannot be ruled out that certain chronic diseases may occasionally deteriorate during the use of combined oral contraceptives. The diseases are those listed as requiring careful observation under ‘Precautions’.   Very rarely, tumours of the liver have been reported in users of combined oral contraceptives, especially it they have been taken for a long time.   Many studies have been reported on the risks of ovarian, endometrial, cervical and breast cancer in women using combined oral contraceptives. The evidence is clear that combined oral contraceptives other substantial protection against both ovarian and endometrial cancer.   An increased risk of cervical cancer in long term users of combined oral contraceptives has been reported in some studies, but this may also be attributable to other factors, such as sexual behaviour.   The evidence linking combined oral contraceptive use and breast cancer remains inconclusive. The results of some studies suggest an increased risk of breast cancer in those under about 35, the risk rising with duration of use. Any possible increased risk of breast cancer with combined oral contraceptives is however likely to be small. This possible risk should be weighed against the many benefits of combined oral contraceptives, including their protective effects against ovarian and endometrial cancers.    Reasons for stopping oral contraceptives immediately.    You should take no further oral contraceptive tablets and should consult your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following: the very first attack of migraine (typically a throbbing headache and nausea, preceded by visual disturbances) that you have ever experienced; worsening of pre-existing migraine; any unusually frequent or unusually severe headaches; dizziness or fainting; sudden disturbance of vision; disturbance of speech; inflamed veins (phlebitis); pains in the chest or abdomen; swelling in the limbs; pain, tingling or numbness in any part of the body; unexplained cough; breathlessness; pain on breathing. Any of these symptoms might indicate the beginning of immediate risk of a serious thrombosis.   The risk of thrombosis is increased after many injuries, especially fractures, during and after many surgical operations, and during immobilisation, eg after accidents. Combined oral contraceptives should be stopped immediately when immobilisation (i.e. inability to move freely) is necessary.     4   Your doctor will probably stop the pill at once if you become jaundiced, or if he finds your blood pressure to be significantly raised, or if any of the conditions known to be capable of deteriorating during oral contraception or pregnancy (referred to under 'Precautions') should show clear signs of deteriorating.   You should stop the pill immediately if pregnancy is diagnosed, or if there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that you may be pregnant, since it has been suggested that combined oral contraceptives, in common with many other substances, might be capable of affecting the normal development of the child in the early stages of pregnancy. It can be definitely concluded, however, that, if a risk of abnormality (foetal & malformation) exists at all, it is very small. q     PRECAUTIONS   Examination of the pelvic organs, breasts and blood pressure should precede the prescribing of any oral contraceptive, and should be repeated regularly. The possibility of existing pregnancy should be ruled out.   The following conditions require careful observation while you are taking the pill: a history of severe depressive states, varicose veins, diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension), fits (epilepsy), the inherited form of deafness known as otosclerosis, the disease of the nervous system called multiple sclerosis, the inherited metabolic disease called porphyria, calcium deficiency with cramps (tetany), disturbed liver function, gallstones, diseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular diseases), kidney diseases, brown patches on the face and body such as occur during pregnancy (chloasma), fibroids of the womb, asthma, the wearing of contact lenses, or any disease that is prone to worsen during  pregnancy (your doctor can explain any of these terms you do not understand). The worsening or first appearance of any of these conditions may indicate that the oral contraceptive should be stopped.   The risk of the deterioration of chloasma, which is often not fully reversible, is reduced by the avoidance of excessive exposure to sunlight.     SIDE EFFECTS   Occasional side effects may include nausea, vomiting, headaches, breast tension, changes in body weight or interest in sex (libido) and depressive moods; and possible deterioration or recurrence of the conditions mentioned in paragraph 2 of 'Precautions'.   It is not easy to decide whether or not something that you notice Is the result of your taking the pill, since among millions of women during long periods of treatment many symptoms are bound to appear that are quite unconnected with the use of the pill. Studies comparing oral contraceptives with dummy tablets have suggested that true side effects experienced by the users are few, and are mainly short-lasting However, such studies may not detect rare or long term side effects. Most known or suspected side effects are of a minor nature and are reversible, but not all. Ask your doctor about any change in your health or general sense of well being that you notice while taking an oral contraceptive.   Store below 30°C In a dry place.    Keep out of the reach of children   Each tablet of LOESTRIN 20 contains 1 mg Norethisterone acetate PhEur and 20 micrograms Ethinyloestradiol PhEur.   Each tablet of LOESTRIN 30 contains 1.5 mg Norethisterone acetate PhEur and 30 micrograms Ethinyloestradiol PhEur.

"    PATIENT INFORMATION LEAFLET PLEASE READ THIS LEAFLET CAREFULLY BEFORE TAKING ADALAT LA 30    Adalat LA 30     What exactly is high blood pressure?   Blood has to be pumped to all the organs in your body.  This job is done by the heart.  As the blood is pumped around the body, it pushes against the walls of your blood vessels creating pressure.  This is your ""blood pressure"".  There are upper and lower limits of blood pressure which are generally accepted as normal.  If your blood pressure is greater than the higher limit, it can be detected, even though it's not necessarily causing you any discomfort.  The medical term for this is   hypertension.    Although high blood pressure may not make you feel ill, it can in the long-term put a strain on your heart because of the extra pumping effort it causes and may lead to other problems such as heart disease or a stroke.     What exactly is angina?   ""Angina"" is a pain usually experienced by patients who are suffering from coronary artery disease.  In this disease the arteries supplying blood to the heart become stiffer and their width may be decreased.  This results in less blood getting to the muscle which makes up the largest part of the heart.  The heart is a muscular pump which circulates the blood throughout the whole body.  It needs oxygen to do this and this is supplied by the blood.  If the arteries which supply the muscle of the heart cannot deliver enough oxygen for the heart muscle to work properly, then pain is experienced.  This pain is known as angina.  Usually, angina occurs upon physical exercise and the pain will stop when the exercise stops.  Sometimes, however, it can occur at rest.   Treating angina will reduce the frequency of your anginal attacks.  However, most medicines which successfully treat angina either improve the blood flow to the heart muscle or reduce the speed of the beating heart.  Either effect may reduce the likelihood of long-term damage to the heart.     Adalat LA 30     What do my tablets contain?   Each tablet contains 30 mg of the active ingredient nifedipine and is marked ""Adalat 30"" on one side.   Adalat LA 30 tablets also contain propylene glycol, cellulose acetate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, polyethylene oxide, polyethylene glycol, magnesium stearate and shellac.  Titanium dioxide (E 171) and iron oxide (E172) are included as colouring agents.  Each tablet also contains 24 mg of sodium chloride (salt).   Adalat LA 30 comes in calendar packs of 14 tablets.  Each tablet has the day of the week printed next to it to remind you when to take it.   The nifedipine contained in Adalat LA 30 is one of a group of medicines called calcium antagonists which are used to treat high blood pressure and to reduce the frequency of anginal attacks.   Product Licence/Authorisation holder: Bayer plc, Pharmaceutical Division, Bayer House, Strawberry Hill, Newbury, Berkshire RG14 1JA.   Manufacturer: Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany.     Why have I been prescribed Adalat LA 30 by my doctor?   Adalat LA 30 has been prescribed by your doctor to treat your high blood pressure or to reduce the frequency of your anginal attacks.  In high blood pressure, nifedipine works by widening the blood vessels.  This creates less resistance to the blood flow, and results in lower blood pressure, which in turn reduces the strain on your heart.  A good comparison is to imagine the difference in pressure you feel when you blow hard through a straw compared with something larger like the cardboard tube in a kitchen roll.  You will feel less pressure with the cardboard tube because the hole is larger.  It creates less resistance in the same way as does a widened blood vessel .   In angina, nifedipine works by opening up the arteries supplying the heart muscle and this allows more blood and oxygen to reach the muscle, decreasing the chances of angina occurring when extra strain is placed upon the heart.     When should I NOT take Adalat LA 30?   Do not take Adalat LA 30 if you have previously had an allergic reaction to the active ingredient nifedipine.  If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor.   Do not take Adalat LA 30 if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.  If you are taking Adalat LA and think that you may be pregnant or are planning a family, consult your doctor.   Do not take Adalat LA if you are taking the antibiotic rifampicin.   These tablets should not be taken if you have a liver disease.  They should also not be taken if you suffer from inflammation of the bowel or intestines (such as Crohn's disease).  Patients with this sort of disease may experience attacks of diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.  Also, if you have, or have had in the past, an obstruction or narrowing of the intestine, you should not take Adalat LA tablets.   If you have been told that you have a narrowing (stenosis) of the aortic valve of the heart, you should not take Adalat LA.   Do not take Adalat LA 30 if you have experienced a collapse of your blood circulation system (cardiogenic shock), during which you would have become breathless, pale and had a cold sweat and dry mouth.   If you are unsure whether you might have any of these conditions, please ask your doctor.     What special precautions should I take?    IMPORTANT: Adalat LA tablets must be swallowed whole.  They will not work properly if they are bitten, chewed or broken up.  If you have difficulty in swallowing tablets, consult your doctor as he/she may wish to change your medicine.    You may see what appears to be the complete tablet in the toilet or associated with your stools.  This is normal as the outer shell of the tablet is not digested by the body.  It does not mean that your tablets are not working.   If you experience chest pains within 4 hours of taking your FIRST dose of Adalat LA, contact your doctor BEFORE YOU TAKE THE NEXT DOSE.  He/she may wish to change your treatment.   Remind your doctor if you suffer from low blood pressure and he/she prescribes Adalat LA for your angina.   If you notice increased breathlessness whilst taking Adalat LA, you should contact your doctor.   If you are a diabetic, the treatment for your diabetes may need to be adjusted.  If you have any questions about this, ask your doctor.  Patients who are receiving kidney dialysis and have a very high blood pressure and low blood volume might experience a sudden drop in their blood pressure when they take Adalat LA.  If you are on kidney dialysis please consult your doctor before taking this medicine.   Adalat LA may interfere with the results of certain urine tests.  If you have given a urine sample, inform the person responsible that you are taking this medicine.   Please inform your doctor if you are taking any of the following:     other drugs to treat high blood pressure     the medicines digoxin, beta-blockers, diltiazem or quinidine which are used to treat heart conditions      cimetidine to treat stomach ulcers     the antibiotic rifampicin       When and how do I take Adalat LA 30?   The Adalat LA tablet is specially formulated so that you only have to take your tablets   once a day  .   Take the tablet as prescribed by your doctor.  Usually this will be one tablet taken at the same time each day, preferably during the morning.  The tablet should be swallowed whole with a glass of water.   It is possible that you may have to take these tablets indefinitely.  You may want to discuss this with your doctor.   DO NOT EXCEED THE PRESCRIBED DOSE.   Exceeding the correct dosage or taking an overdose may cause your blood pressure to become too low and your beats to become irregular.  Also, it may lead to nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting, a lack of energy, drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, flushing and, possibly, even unconsciousness.    If you take more than the prescribed dose, or in the event of an overdose, seek medical advice immediately and, if possible, take your tablets or the box with you to show the doctor.      What should I do if I forget to take by Adalat LA?   You should take your normal dose immediately and then continue taking your tablets as prescribed.  However, it is best to allow at least 12 hours before taking your next dose to restore your normal time of dosing.     What side-effects may I experience?   As with all medicines, a number of side-effects are known for Adalat LA.  You may experience swelling of the ankles or legs, headache, flushing, a fast or irregular heartbeat (palpitations), feeling sick (nausea), loss of energy (fatigue), dizziness or numbness in the hands and feet.  These side-effects should go away with time.   Bleeding, tender or swollen gums may occur some time after starting Adalat LA.   Skin reactions such as a rash, itching or hives may occur.   You may experience muscle pain, trembling or visual disturbances.   You may experience an increase in the need to pass water.    Occasionally, the treatment of high blood pressure may lead to slight breast swelling in older men.  This side-effect goes away when treatment is stopped.   As with all medicines, some people may be allergic to Adalat LA.  Usually, if you are allergic to Adalat LA, a reaction will occur when you start taking the tablets.  Allergic reactions can affect the liver and appear as yellowing of the skin (jaundice) or they can cause symptoms such as a rash and fever.   Very rarely, some people experience a purple/brown discolouration of the skin or redness, flaking and itching of the skin.  Also, it has been known for people to develop a rash or blistering of the skin when they are exposed to sunlight.   All of the symptoms above go away when treatment with Adalat LA is stopped.   IF YOU EXPERIENCE ANY OF THESE EFFECTS OR ANY OTHER UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS, TELL YOUR DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY.  YOUR DOCTOR WILL GIVE YOU ADVICE.     How should I store my Adalat LA 30 tablets?   It is best if you keep your Adalat LA tablets in the original box supplied.  The tablets should be protected from strong light, so only remove the tablet from the box or blister strip when you are about to take it.   The tablets should be kept in a cool, dry place where the temperature is not likely to be greater than 30ºC, eg your bedroom rather than your bathroom.   KEEP ALL MEDICINES OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN.   Do not use tablets after the expiry date which is marked on both the outer carton and on each blister strip of tablets.

"      Schering PC4™    This booklet is designed to help you to use Schering PC4 correctly, and to answer many of the questions that you may have about emergency contraception. Please read it carefully to get the best from Schering PC4. If you are in any doubt about these instructions contact your doctor, pharmacist or Family Planning clinic.    An introduction to Schering PC4    How does Schering PC4 work?   If you have sex and do not use contraception you can get pregnant. Your ovaries release an egg each month (ovulation) which travels to a fallopian tube. When you make love, your partner's penis releases millions of sperm into your vagina. Some of these sperm travel up through your womb into your fallopian tubes. If there is an egg in one of these tubes, and a sperm reaches it, the egg is fertilised. The fertilised egg then travels to the womb and gets embedded in the lining of the womb. If the egg attaches to the lining of the womb it starts to grow into a baby. It can take 3 days for the fertilised egg to travel to the womb.   Schering PC4 stops the fertilised egg from attaching itself to the lining of the womb. It can only do this if it is taken within three days of unprotected intercourse. Therefore, this medicine can only be used within three days (72 hours) of unprotected sex.     How effective is Schering PC4?   After you have unprotected sex you may or may not become pregnant. It is therefore very difficult to know how many pregnancies have been stopped by Schering PC4.   The important thing is that very few women are pregnant after taking Schering PC4 correctly.     How often can you use Schering PC4?   Schering PC4 is only an emergency contraceptive. This means that you should not use it as your normal contraceptive. You should discuss a regular contraceptive with your doctor. In another emergency, Schering PC4 can be used again but not before you have had a period.     Before you take Schering PC4   Schering PC4 contains the same sex hormones that are contained in a number of oral contraceptives. The reasons for not using oral contraceptives and the same precautions should be applied to Schering PC4 also. They are listed later in this booklet and you should refer to them.     Product information The name of your medicine is: Schering PC4     What does your medicine contain?   Each pack of Schering PC4 contains 4 white sugar-coated tablets. Each tablet contains 500 micrograms of the progestogen norgestrel and 50 micrograms of the oestrogen ethinyloestradiol (INN ethinylestradiol). Progestogen and oestrogen are both female types of hormone.   Each tablet also contains the following inactive ingredients: lactose, maize starch, povidone, talc, magnesium stearate (E572), sucrose, polyethylene glycol 6000, calcium carbonate (E170), montan glycol wax.   Each pack of Schering PC4 contains a strip of 4 tablets.   Schering PC4 is an emergency contraceptive.    The product licence is held by:   Schering Health Care Ltd, The Brow, Burgess Hill, West Sussex RH15 9NE.    Product licence number:   0053/0162.    Schering PC4 is manufactured by:   Schering AG, Berlin, Germany.     Uses   Emergency contraception within 72 hours (3 days) of unprotected sex as an occasional emergency measure.      Reasons for not taking Schering PC4   You should not take this medicine if:     You are pregnant or think you may already be pregnant.     Your period is late.     Since your last period you have had unprotected sex which occurred more than 72 hours ago.     Also, you must not take this medicine if you have any of these:     blood clots in the legs, lungs, eyes, or anywhere else or have ever had these. If you have had a heart attack or if you have any medical condition which makes you more at risk of developing blood clots.     abnormal red blood cells (sickle-cell anaemia).     disorders of blood fat (lipid) metabolism.     cancer of the breast or of the lining of the womb (mammary or endometrial carcinoma) or have ever had either of these conditions.     abnormal bleeding from your vagina of unknown cause.     certain types of jaundice (Dubin-Johnson or Rotor syndromes).     severe diabetes with changes to the blood vessels.     liver tumours or have ever had these.     any other long or short term liver disease.     allergy to any of the ingredients of Schering PC4.     Do not take this medicine if you have had any of these conditions when you were pregnant:     itching of whole body (pruritus of pregnancy).     the rash known as herpes gestationis.     worsening of inherited deafness (otosclerosis).     yellowing of the skin (jaundice).       What you should know before taking Schering PC4   Before you take this medicine your pelvic organs, breasts and blood pressure will normally be checked by your doctor. The doctor will also make sure you are not pregnant.     The following conditions need watching carefully if     you take Schering PC4:   If you have:     severe depressive states, past or present.     diabetes (diabetes mellitus) or a tendency towards diabetes.     high blood pressure (hypertension).     fits (epilepsy).     the inherited form of deafness known as otosclerosis.     the inherited disease called porphyria.     calcium deficiency with cramps (tetany).     diseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular diseases).     kidney diseases.     disturbed liver function.     you are very overweight (obese).     gallstones.     migraine.     or, if:     anyone in your family has had any illness caused by blood clots, or a heart attack or stroke at a young age.       Taking other medicines with Schering PC4   Some medicines may stop Schering PC4 from working properly. If you are taking any other medicine while you are taking Schering PC4, be sure to tell your doctor. Medicines which may stop Schering PC4 from working properly are antibiotics (such as ampicillin and rifampicin); griseofulvin (which is used to treat fungal infections); phenylbutazone (which is used as an anti-inflammatory drug to treat some types of joint diseases); phenytoin, primidone, phenobarbitone and some other medicines used in people with epilepsy, and carbamazepine (which can be used to treat epilepsy or other illnesses).   If you are diabetic your doctor may alter the dose of medicine required to treat your diabetes.   If you are in doubt check with your doctor, pharmacist or Family Planning clinic.       Warnings   Schering PC4 does not appear to be as effective as some regularly-used methods of contraception and is suitable only as an occasional emergency measure. It is not effective if started later than 72 hours after unprotected intercourse. In another emergency, Schering PC4 can be used again but not before you have had a period.   Being sick or having very bad diarrhoea, or diseases of the small bowel that interfere with the absorption of food, might also reduce the effect of your medicine.   Although Schering PC4 protects against implantation of a fertilised egg in the womb, it appears to offer no protection against the rare abnormal implantations that occur in the uterine tubes or other abnormal sites (ectopic pregnancies). Therefore, if you should become pregnant despite taking this medicine, there may be a greater chance than usual that the pregnancy is ectopic.   When this medicine is used during breast-feeding the amount of milk may be reduced. Very small amounts of the active ingredients of Schering PC4 are found in breast milk.   Experts believe that this medicine is not capable of causing abnormalities to the developing child if it is taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex and in the absence of a pre-existing pregnancy.   It has been suggested, on the basis of statistical evidence that the risk of developing various disorders of the circulation of the blood is slightly greater in women who take the combined pill (oestrogen-progestogen combinations like Schering PC4) than in those who do not. This can lead to, for example, deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in the leg), strokes (blood clots and haemorrhages from the blood vessels of the brain), heart attacks or pulmonary embolism (blood clots blocking the arteries of the lungs). People do not always fully recover from these disorders, and, very rarely, they are fatal.   Certain conditions increase the risk of thrombosis. They include:     smoking.     obesity.     some diseases of the heart and blood vessels.     diabetes.     migraine.     a major operation or period of mobilisation (e.g. you are in bed after an accident or operation or you have a plaster cast on a broken leg)     if any members of your family have suffered from thromboembolic diseases (e.g. deep vein thrombosis, stroke or heart attack) at a young age.     varicose veins.     The following may be symptoms of blood clot formation or symptoms of an inflammation of veins combined with the formation of blood clots (thrombophlebitis)—unusual pains in your leg or unusual swelling of your arms or leg, sharp pains in your chest or sudden shortness of breath, crushing pains or feelings of heaviness in your chest, coughing for no apparent reason, or if one side of your body suddenly becomes very weak or numb.   If any of these conditions apply to you before you decide to take Schering PC4 or while you are taking it you must discuss them with your doctor.   The risk of arterial thrombosis (e.g. heart attack and stroke) associated with the pill increases with age, and this risk is increased by cigarette smoking. For this reason, the use of Schering PC4 by women in the  older age-group, especially those who also smoke, is discouraged.     How to take your medicine   Take 2 tablets as soon as possible after you have had unprotected sex (but no later than 72 hours).   Take the other 2 tablets 12 hours after the first dose.   Nausea/vomiting is less likely if the tablets are taken after a light meal.   It is important to leave no longer than 12 hours between the 2 doses.   This is all your need to do unless you are sick (vomit) within 2 hours of taking either dose.     What to do if you are sick (vomit)   If you are sick within 2 hours of taking the first 2 tablets you should take the other 2 tablets in the pack at once and contact your doctor immediately for more tablets.   If you are sick within 2 hours of taking the second 2 tablets you should contact your doctor immediately.     What to expect after you have taken your medicine  Nausea   You may feel sick, and if you actually vomit within 2 hours of taking your tablets you must follow the advice given above.     Menstrual bleed   Your next period may be earlier or later than the expected time. If your next period is delayed by more than two weeks you should visit your doctor for a pregnancy test.     Future contraception   You should either not have sex or use another method of contraception (condoms or cap plus spermicide) until your next period. Discuss your future contraceptive needs with your doctor and choose a regular method of contraception.   It is suggested that you should visit your doctor three weeks after taking Schering PC4 to discuss your future contraceptive needs and to make sure that you are not pregnant.     What to do if you miss a dose   You must take both doses and leave no longer than 12 hours between the 2 doses. If you are late taking the second dose, take it as soon as you remember and contact your doctor for advice as soon as possible as you may need an additional dose.     Overdosage   There have been no reports of serious ill-effects from overdosage. Contact your doctor or pharmacist if you are at all worried.     Side-effects   Nausea, vomiting, breast discomfort and headaches have been reported. Disturbance of the pattern of menstrual bleeding is usual.   If you think that you have an unwanted effect due to Schering PC4, even if it has not been mentioned, or you have a serious reaction as described earlier in this booklet, tell your doctor or pharmacist about it.    Expiry date:   The expiry date is printed on the pack. Do not use after this date.    Storage:   Keep all medicines out of the reach of children.

"      Curosurf (Poractant alfa) Presentation   Single dose vials containing a sterile suspension for intratracheal administration.   One 1.5 ml vial contains 120 mg of phospholipid fraction from porcine lung along with Sodium Chloride EP 13.5 mg and Water for Injections EP 1.5 ml.   One 3 ml vial contains 240 mg of phospholipid fraction from porcine lung along with Sodium Chloride EP 27 mg and Water for Injections EP 3 ml.    Uses   Curosurf is a natural surfactant used for the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS or hyaline membrane disease) in newborn babies, who have a minimum birthweight of 700 g.     Dosage and administration   Curosurf should only be administered by those trained and experienced in the care and resuscitation of preterm infants. It is administered via the intratracheal route in intubated infants undergoing mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress syndrome and whose heart and arterial oxygen saturation are being continuously monitored. Intubation should not be undertaken merely to administer surfactant.   It is advisable to commence the treatment as soon as possible after diagnosing RDS. Therapy with Curosurf starting more than 48 hours after diagnosing RDS has not been investigated.   Curosurf is available in ready-to-use vials that should be stored in a refrigerator at +2 to +8 C. The vial should be slowly warmed to 37 C before use, e.g. by holding it in an incubator for about one hour or in a thermostated bath for about three minutes, and gently turned upside down, without shaking, in order to obtain a uniform suspension.   The suspension should be withdrawn from the vial using a sterile needle and syringe.   Initially, a single dose of 100-200 mg/kg (1.252.5 ml/kg) is advised.   Up to two further doses of 100 mg/kg administered at about 12-hourly intervals may also be indicated in infants who remain intubated and in whom RDS is considered responsible for their persisting or deteriorating respiratory status (maximum total dose of 300-400 mg/kg).    The initial dose is administered as follows:   Disconnect the baby momentarily from the ventilator and administer 1.25 to 2.5ml/kg of suspension, as a single bolus, directly into the lower trachea via the endotracheal tube.   Perform approximately one minute of hand-bagging and then reconnect the baby to the ventilator at the same settings as before administration.   Further doses (1.25 ml/kg) that may be required are administered in the same manner.   After administration of Curosurf and upon reconnection to the ventilator or immediately after pulmonary compliance (chest expansion) can improve rapidly thus requiring prompt adjustment of the ventilator settings.   The improvement of alveolar gas exchange can result in a rapid increase of arterial oxygen concentration: therefore, a rapid adjustment of the inspired oxygen concentration should be made to avoid hyperoxia. In order to maintain proper blood oxygenation values, in addition to periodic haemo-gas analysis, continuous monitoring of transcutaneous PaO2 or oxygen saturation, is also advisable.    Contra-indications, warnings etc.     Contra-indications:   No specific contra-indications are yet known.    Precautions:   The baby's general condition should be stabilised. Correction of acidosis, hypotension, anaemia, hypoglycaemia and hypothermia is also recommended    Babies born following very prolonged rupture of the membranes (greater than 3 weeks) may not show optimal response.   Surfactant administration can be expected to reduce the severity of RDS but cannot be expected to eliminate entirely the mortality and morbidity associated with preterm birth, as preterm babies may be exposed to other complications of their immaturity.   After administration a transient depression of cerebro-electrical activity has been recorded lasting 2 to 10 minutes. The impact of this is not clear.    Use in pregnancy and lactation:   Not applicable.    Drug interactions:   None known.    Side-effects:   Pulmonary haemorrhage, the incidence of which increases the more immature is the infant, is a rare and sometimes fatal complication of preterm delivery. No evidence exists of any increased risk of this event following the administration of Curosurf .   No other undesirable effects have been reported.    Overdosage:   There have been no reports of overdosage following the administration of Curosurf.   However, in the unlikely event of accidental overdose, and only if there are clear clinical effects on the infant's respiration, ventilation or oxygenation, as much of the suspension as possible should be aspirated and the baby should be managed with supportive treatment, with particular attention to fluid and electrolyte balance.    Pharmaceutical precautions   The product must be stored in a refrigerator at +2 to +8°C protected from light until the moment of use.   Any residual quantity in the vial must not be used after the first aspiration.   Warmed vials should not be returned to the refrigerator.   A slight colour change towards yellow may occur on ageing without denoting the product’s impairment.

It is available as a sterile suspension containing 120 or 240 mg of its active ingredient which is the phospho-lipid fraction from porcine lung.      What's in your baby's medicine   In addition to the active ingredient Curosurf also contains sodium chloride and water for injections.

Why Curosurf?   Your baby has been given Curosurf because he/she is suffering from a condition called respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).   Most babies are born with a substance known as surfactant in their lungs. This substance lines the lungs and stops them from sticking together and so makes normal breathing (respiration) possible. Some babies, however, particularly premature babies, are born with a lack of this surfactant which causes RDS.   Curosurf is a natural surfactant which works in the same way as your baby's own surfactant would have done and, therefore, will help your baby to breathe normally until your baby produces his or her own surfactant.    Note:   Curosurf is expected to help in the treatment of RDS but cannot be expected to help with other problems which are sometimes associated with premature babies      How many doses will your baby have?   It is important that Curosurf is given as soon as possible after RDS has been diagnosed. Your baby will be/has been given one dose and may receive another two doses at l2 hourly intervals: your doctor will decide how much is necessary for your baby.     How will Curosurf be given to your baby?   Curosurf is given to your baby whilst it is in the incubator. It is given through tubes into the baby's trachea (windpipe).     Can Curosurf cause side-effects?   All medicines can cause side-effects. However, clinical studies on several thousands of newborn babies with RDS did not demonstrate any side effects of surfactant therapy.   This leaflet provides a summary of the information available on your baby’s medicine. If you have questions or are not sure of anything, then please ask your doctor who will have access to additional information.   The information on this leaflet applies only to Curosurf.

Serotonin is one of these chemicals, and appears to be at low levels in people who are depressed.

This is because it takes a while for your tablets to rebalance the serotonin in your brain. But, once this starts to happen, you will notice the difference.     It is important that, even when you begin to feel better, you keep taking your tablets until your doctor tells you to stop. This will reduce the chance of your depression returning.      REMEMBER    Depression is a common illness.It is nothing to be ashamed of.     It is not a sign of weakness.It can be treated successfully.

This leaflet provides a summary of the information available on the vaccine.  If you have any questions or are not sure about anything, ask your doctor.   The name of this product is ARILVAX, or YELLOW FEVER VACCINE, LIVE BP.  It is one of a group of medicines called vaccines, which are used to protect people against infectious diseases.    What is in the vaccine?   Arilvax contains a freeze-dried powder of a live, weakened yellow fever virus (the same type of virus that causes the infectious disease yellow fever except that the weakened virus cannot cause the disease).  The powder is mixed with sterile water before use.   When mixed with the sterile water supplied with the vaccine, each 0.5ml dose of the vaccine contains the equivalent of not less than 1000 units of the weakened strain of the virus.  The vaccine also contains polymyxin B sulphate, neomycin sulphate, sorbitol, gelatin, sodium chloride, disodium hydrogen orthophosphate, potassium chloride, potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate, water and traces of egg derived protein.

Your doctor will mix the freeze-dried powder and sterile water together and will withdraw 0.5ml of the mixture into a syringe for your (or your child’s) vaccination.     How does the vaccine work?   When you are vaccinated with Arilvax your body produces a response (involving the production of antibodies) against the weakened yellow fever virus.

The Product Authorisation and Product Licence Holder and Manufacturer are:   Evans Medical Limited, Leatherhead, KT22 7PQ, England.     What is the vaccine used for?

The vaccine mixture should be shaken gently to ensure mixing of the freeze-dried powder and sterile water, before each dose is withdrawn from the container into a syringe for your (or your child’s) injection.  The injection needle should not come Into contact with disinfectant or spirit (alcohol) as these my reduce the vaccine’s effectiveness.   Your doctor will inject a single 0.5ml dose of the vaccine under the skin.  Children aged 9 months or over, adults and elderly all receive the same dose of vaccine.   Your doctor will write down the name, dose and lot number of the vaccine, and the date it was given in your (or your child’s) medical records.  However, it may help you to remember what vaccines you have received if you also make note of the name and dose of the vaccines, and the date on which they were given.     How long will you be protected against yellow fever?   One injection of Arilvax should protect you against yellow fever for 10 years.  When 10 years or more have passed, another (booster) injection is needed if you require further protection.     Do you need a certificate of vaccination?   It you live in, or are travelling to or from, a country where yellow fever is known to exist, you may be asked to provide written evidence that you have received yellow fever vaccination.  Ask your doctor whether or not you will require a certificate of vaccination.  If you are receiving a first dose of the vaccine, the certificate will be valid for a period of ten years from the tenth day alter vaccination.  If you are receiving a second (booster) dose within 10 years of the first dose, the certificate will be valid at once.     What side effects might you experience?   Severe side-effects following vaccination are extremely rare and may include allergic reactions and encephalitis (this may show as tiredness, fatigue, muscle weakness and paralysis).  Encephalitis has been reported mostly in babies under 9 months of age (therefore it is recommended that babies under 9 months of age are not vaccinated with this vaccine).   Sometimes, a reaction at the injection-site, such as soreness, redness and swelling may occur.  A headache following vaccination has also sometimes been reported.  A few days after vaccination you may develop stiff muscles and a temperature.  If these side-effects are troublesome or last more than a few days, TELL YOUR DOCTOR.   In very rare instances, rash, inflammation of a bursa (a structure associated with a joint), liver problems (a sign of which is yellowing of the skin, called jaundice) and nerve inflammation (symptoms of which may be a pain numbness and tingling) have been reported following vaccination.  If any of these happen, TELL YOUR DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY.   If you (or your child) have any other unwanted effects not mentioned above, TELL YOUR DOCTOR.     Use-by date and storage   The freeze-dried powder should be refrigerated between 2-5°C.  It should be protected from light.  The sterile water for mixing with the vaccine should be stored below 25°C (at room temperature): it should not be frozen.  Once the powder and sterile water have been mixed, the mixture should be kept cool, protected from light and used within 1 hour.  The vaccine should not be used after the ""Use-by"" date on the label.     Further Information   This leaflet does not contain the complete information about this vaccine.

"      Gonal-F 75 or 150    Qualitative and quantitative composition   Active ingredient: 75 IU or 150 IU follitropin alpha.   Excipients: Sucrose, Sodium dihydrogen phosphate, Disodium phosphate, phosphoric acid, sodium hydroxide.     Pharmaceutical form   Lyophilised sterile powder, for injection after reconstitution with accompanying diluent(Sterile Water for injection).     Uses   FSH, is a natural hormone, secreted by the anterior pituitary, a gland at the base of the brain. Gonal-F is used to treat infertility in women.     Authorisation holder and manufacturer   Authorisation holder: Ares-Serono (Europe) Ltd., 112 Harley Street, London W1N 1AF.   Manufacturer: Serono Pharma S.p.A., 70123 Bari, Italy.     Therapeutic indications   The medication should only be used under the strict supervision of a physician.   Gonal-F is used to bring about the development of several follicles (and therefore several eggs) for women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian transfer (GIFT) or zygote intra-fallopian transfer (ZIFT).     Contraindications   Gonal-F should not be used when one of the following conditions exist:     pregnancy     ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease     gynaecological bleeding of unknown cause     ovarian, uterine or mammary cancer     tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland     case of prior allergic reaction to medicines containing FSH.     The medicine should not be used when a condition exists which would make a normal pregnancy impossible, such as premature menopause, malformation of sexual organs or specific tumours of the womb.     Special warnings and precautions for use   Before the treatment is started, you and your partners fertility will be evaluated.   Patients using this treatment for development of several follicles are at an increased risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (see undesirable effects). Gonal-F treatment seldom gives rise to significant OHSS unless the medicine used to induce final follicular maturation (containing human chorionic gonadotropin-hCG) is administered. It is therefore prudent to withhold administration of hCG in cases when OHSS is developing and not to have sexual intercourse for at least four days.   The risk of multiple pregnancy following assisted reproductive technologies is related to the number of oocytes/embryos replaced.   Pregnancy loss (miscarriage) is higher than normal, but comparable with the rates found in women with fertility problems.   There have been no reports of allergic reactions to Gonal-F. If you had this type of reaction to similar medicines, inform your doctor.     Interaction with other medications and other forms of interaction   Concomitant use of Gonal-F with other agents used to stimulate ovulation may potentiate the ovarian response, whereas concurrent use of a gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist-induced pituitary desensitisation may increase the dosage of Gonal-F needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response.   No drug incompatibilities have been reported for Gonal-F.    Gonal-F should not be administered as a mixture with other drugs in the same injection.     Use during pregnancy and lactation   Gonal-F should not be administered in case of pregnancy and lactation.     Dosage   A commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150 225 IU of Gonal-F daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by blood monitoring and/or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient’s response, to usually not higher than 450 IU daily. In general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days).   A single injection of the medicine used to induce final follicular maturation and containing up to 10 000 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is administered 24 48 hours after the last Gonal-F injection.   In other cases, down-regulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone {GnRH) agonist is used. In these cases, Gonal-F is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 225 IU Gonal-F are administered for the first 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response.     Method and route of administration   Gonal-F is intended for subcutaneous administration and is for single use only.   If you administer Gonal-F to yourself, please care fully read the following instructions:     Wash your hands. It is important that your hands and the items you use be as clean as possible.     Assemble everything you need: find a clean area and lay out everything (two alcohol swabs, one diluent ampoule, one ampoule containing the medication, one syringe, one needle for reconstitution and a fine bore needle for subcutaneous injection).     Open the ampoule: You should have one ampoule containing clear liquid (the diluent)and a set number of ampoules containing Gonal-F (the white powder). On the head of the diluent ampoule, you will see a small coloured dot. Directly below it is where the neck of the ampoule has been treated to make it easier to break. Gently flick the top section of the ampoule so that any fluid in the neck of the ampoule drops into the bottom chamber. Now press the ampoule firmly over the neck, and break the ampoule   away   from the coloured dot. Carefully place the open ampoule upright on the work surface       Draw up the diluent: Attach the needle for reconstitution to the syringe, with the syringe in one hand pick up the open ampoule, insert the needle and draw up all of the diluent. Carefully set the syringe down on the work surface, taking care not to touch the needle.      Inject the solution: Your doctor or nurse will have already advised you where to inject (e.g. tummy, front of thigh). Wipe the chosen area with an alcohol swab.

Read the leaflet fully and carefully before using the SUBJECT Pen.   DO NOT LOAD THE PEN UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO GIVE THE INJECTION     Learn the names of the parts in the picture in ""Description of Parts"".     Swing open the lid of the Carrycase     Tear off the tamper-evident seal from ONE of the Cartridges.       Take out the SUBJECT Pen from the Carrycase. The spring mechanism will be primed ready for use – the white plunger rod should not be sticking out beyond the end of the pen. (See picture 11).        Keeping your finger off the blue release button pull the loaded SUBJECT Pen straight out of the Carrycase. You may have to pull quite hard to do this. A safety catch stops accidental injection until you are ready.     The loaded Pen is now ready for immediate use.    DO NOT try to put the loaded Pen back into the Carrycase   as this will damage the needle     Press the nose end of the loaded SUBJECT Pen firmly onto a clean area of skin - usually the outside of the thigh (as in picture) - so the grey part slides over the blue part. This releases the safety catch.        Push the SUBJECT Pen firmly into the opened Cartridge Pack and screw it clockwise   (about half a turn)   until it will twist no further.              Immediately return the used Cartridge Syringe to the Cartridge Pack – pushing the SUBJECT Pen down into the empty space in the Cartridge Pack as far as it will go.     Then screw the SUBJECT Pen by twisting it anti-clockwise   (about half a turn)   until the SUBJECT Pen comes off the Cartridge.         Now press the blue Release button at the top of the SUBJECT Pen and count to 10 keeping the SUBJECT Pen very still.

Hold the Carrycase and press the two blue locating buttons with one hand.           Gently pull out the Cartridge Pack with the other hand.     Be careful to dispose of your empty Cartridge Packs safely. The Cartridge Pack will hold the used SUBJECT Cartridge Syringes and needles until you can safely dispose of them. You should be able to do this at your doctor's surgery - so ask your doctor or practice nurse.       HOW TO PUT A NEW CARTRIDGE PACK INTO THE CARRY CASE   Each SUBJECT comes complete with an IMIGRAN Cartridge Pack which contains two pre-filled Cartridge Syringes.   This part of the leaflet describes how to use a SUBJECT Refill Pack to re-load the Carrycase.       Swing open the lid of the Carrycase, the SUBJECT Pen is already in its place.

Product licence holder:   Janssen-Cilag Ltd, Saunderton, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire HP14 4HJ.     Manufactured by:   Patches: LTS Lohmann GmbH & Co KG, Lohmannstrasse 2, D-56626 Andernach, Germany.   Tablets: Cilag AG, Hochstrasse 201/209, CH-8201 Schaffhausen, Switzerland.     What is Evorel Pak used for?   Evorel Pak is used for hormone replacement therapy in the treatment of symptoms of the menopause. These may be caused by a lack of naturally occurring oestrogens and progestogens.     What is the menopause?   Women produce oestrogen hormones from their ovaries throughout their adult life. These hormones have many effects, e.g., sexual development and control of the menstrual cycle.   The menopause occurs when a woman's ovaries cease to function and there is a decline in the levels of hormones produced by the ovaries, one of these being oestrogen. This is a gradual process which takes place over a number of years - a time known as the 'change of life'. During this time oestrogen levels fluctuate and decline and it is this which causes symptoms such as hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings and local vaginal symptoms such as dryness and itching and uncomfortable or painful intercourse.     How do Evorel patches work?   The Evorel patch replaces the natural oestrogen that is normally released by the ovaries. It does this by passing oestrogen from the patch into the body through the skin. The active levels of oestrogen in the body are reached about 4 hours after the patch is  applied to the skin and last for 3 to 4 days after which the patch must be changed.     How do Norethisterone tablets work?   In women who still have a uterus(womb), taking oestrogen regularly may cause the lining of the womb to build up and thicken. It is necessary to shed this lining regularly to prevent any problems occurring. Adding a progestogen hormone to the oestrogen treatment for approximately 12 days of the 28 day cycle, will cause the lining to be shed to protect the womb. This produces a few days of withdrawal bleeding at the end of each cycle, rather like a period.     Is Evorel Pak safe for you to use?   Do not use Evorel Pak if you are pregnant or think that you might be pregnant or you are breast feeding.   Do not used Evorel Pak if you have, or have ever had, cancer of the breast or womb, or other cancers known to be sensitive to oestrogens.   Do not use Evorel Pak if you have any of the following: severe liver, kidney or heart disease; blood clots (thrombosis); inflammation of veins; undiagnosed vaginal bleeding; endometriosis; hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in Evorel patches or the tablets; Rotor Syndrome or Dubin-Johnson Syndrome or if you had jaundice, severe itching or a skin condition called pemphigoid gestationis during pregnancy.   If you have any of the conditions listed below you may still be able to use Evorel Pak but you should discuss this with your doctor first. It may be necessary for you to be seen more regularly whilst you are taking this treatment.   History of: thrombosis/blood clots, stroke, heart attack, epilepsy or diabetes, high blood pressure, certain liver problems which may cause jaundice, breast disease, family history of breast cancer, fibroids, gallstones, otosclerosis (bone formation in the ear),multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; Lupus), porphyria, melanoma, asthma, as these conditions may be worsened by oestrogen HRT.   If you are not sure about any of the conditions mentioned above please consult your doctor.     Special warnings   It is important that you have a full and thorough physical and gynaecological examination and that your own and family's medical histories are taken before you start any Hormone Replacement Therapy.   There is some evidence that HRT may increase the risk of breast cancer in post menopausal women. If you have taken HRT for 5 years you should discuss with your doctor whether you should receive further HRT treatment.   If you still have your womb (i.e., have not had a hysterectomy) taking oestrogen alone may increase the risk of overgrowth of the womb lining. Thus it is very important that you use the norethisterone tablets as instructed together with the Evorel patches from this pack.   You should receive regular full medical examinations whilst using Evorel Pak.   If you have had a blood clot in the leg or lung, a stroke or a heart attack or are immobile for any reason such as after an operation, you may still be able to use Evorel Pak but your doctor should decide this and check you regularly if you do use it. If this occurs while taking Evorel Pak, treatment should be stopped and your doctor contacted immediately.   Evorel Pak should not be used by children.   Evorel Pak should not be used for contraception.     Are you taking other medicines?   Some medicines can alter the way Evorel Pak works, such as barbiturates, phenytoin, carbamazepine, meprobamate, phenylbutazone, antibiotics, rifampicin, charcoal. If you are taking any of these medicines consult your doctor.     How should you use Evorel Pak?      How to use the Evorel patches There is enough oestrogen hormone in each patch to last for several days but to ensure a steady supply   to the body, the patches must be changed at 3 or 4 day intervals.      To make it easy to remember when this should be done, keep to the same two days every week. This will mean that one patch is on for three days and the other for four days. For example, if you use your first patch on a Monday, it should be changed on Thursday and again on the following Monday.   You can work out your two days from the following table, starting from the first day of use:    If you put your   first patch on:Change onChange again on MondayThursdayMonday TuesdayFridayTuesday WednesdaySaturdayWednesday ThursdaySundayThursday FridayMondayFriday SaturdayTuesdaySaturday SundayWednesdaySunday    To help you remember your ""two patch change"" days, mark them as shown:      MonTuesWedThurFriSatSun ThurFriSatSunMon Tues Wed   Also, write your start date in the box provided on the lid. This date will be your day 1 of therapy.      When to use the tablets:      You should take one tablet a day for 12 days towards the end of each 28 day cycle i.e. days 15 to 26 (day 15 will be the day you apply your 5th patch).   Further illustration of when to take your patches and tablets is shown inside Evorel Pak.   If you have problems with the bleed at the end of taking the tablets, please discuss this with your doctor.    How to put the patch on   The patch should be applied to clean, dry skin but not on top of cuts, spots or other skin blemishes OR on an area where you have just applied cream, moisturiser or talc.   The Evorel patch should be applied to the skin as soon as it is removed from the wrapper and applied as described below.     Tear open the wrapper, first between the 'V's along one edge and then along the other edge. Take out the patch.     With the silver release liner facing you, bend the patch and peel off one half of the foil. Do not touch the sticky side of the patch otherwise it may not stick properly.     Apply the open half of the patch to your skin, remove the other half of the foil and press down the rest of the patch.     Press the patch with the palm of your hand to ensure it is firmly stuck to the skin.     To remove, peel away an edge of the patch and pull smoothly away from the skin.     You may use baby oil to help remove any gum/ glue which may remain on your skin after patch removal.      Where to place the Evorel patch   Most women prefer to wear the patch on the thigh or bottom.   It should NEVER be worn on or near the breasts.   Although it can be worn underneath clothing, it should not be placed under elasticated waistbands.   The patch should not be placed on the same area of skin twice in a row.     What if the patch falls off?   Just apply a new patch and keep to your original 'patch change' days. If you have just had a bath or shower, wait until your skin cools before applying a new patch.     What if I forget to change the patch?   Just change it as soon as possible and then keep to your original 'patch change' days.      What to do if you overdose with Evorel or Norethisterone tablets?   Overdosage with the patch is unlikely. Effects of too much oestrogen can be reversed simply by removal of the patch. The most common symptoms of oestrogen overdose are breast tenderness, nausea and irregular bleeding.   There have been no reports of serious ill effects from overdose of norethisterone tablets. If nausea and vomiting or any other problems occur please contact your doctor or nearest hospital casualty department for advice.     What side effects might Evorel Pak cause?   As with any other medicines, in a few women, treatment with Evorel Pak may cause some unwanted effects. Most are usually minor and will disappear within a couple of months and should not need you to stop treatment. They are: headaches, migraines, dizziness, local skin irritation or rash (if so please remove patch and consult doctor), nausea, vomiting, abdominal pains, bloating, jaundice, irregular vaginal bleeding, pre-menstrual tension-type symptoms, breast tenderness, increase in breast size nipple secretions, increase in size of fibroids, vaginal thrush, change in genital secretions, cystitis-like symptoms, patches of darkened skin, small red marks on skin, red lumpy swellings on the legs, bruise-like marks on the skin. The patches of darkened skin may not disappear even when you stop using Evorel Pak. Hair loss, excessive hair growth, problems with contact lenses, depression, changes in body weight, water retention (you may notice swollen ankles), leg cramps, change in libido (interest in sex), involuntary limb movements, aggravation of porphyria, raised blood sugar may also occur.   If such effects occur and become troublesome, frequent and/or more severe please consult your doctor for advice.   If you notice any other symptoms not listed above whilst using Evorel Pak, please tell your doctor about them.     How should you store Evorel Pak?   Keep away from direct sunlight. Store at room temperature (at or below 25ºC).    Other important points:   Keep out of reach of children.     Do not use this pack:   After the expiry date shown on the label. If the tablets or patches are not as described above. If the patch pouch is open.     Answers to some common questions about the patch     Can I wash, bathe or shower as normal?   YES, but do not scrub too hard in case you loosen the edges of the patch.     Can I go swimming with the patch on?   YES, the patch will not be affected.     Can I exercise or play sports?   YES, try to avoid wearing it under tight clothing or waistband.     Can I sunbathe with the patch on?   YES, but keep the patch covered to avoid direct sunlight.     What if I am allergic to the patch?   As with normal sticking plaster, allergic reactions to the patch are unlikely. However, should you have such a reaction, please consult your doctor.     Does the patch work as a contraceptive?   NO, the levels of hormone supplied by the Evorel patch are too low for it to do this. Although menopausal women face an ever-decreasing risk of pregnancy, normal precautions should be taken during sexual intercourse. If in doubt, consult your doctor.

SOME OF THE INFORMATION IN YOUR PREVIOUS LEAFLET MAY HAVE CHANGED.     Keep this leaflet. You may want to read it again.     THIS MEDICINE IS FOR USE ONLY IN MEN        WHAT IS IN YOUR TABLETS?      Active ingredient   The active ingredient in ‘Proscar’ tablets is finasteride. ‘Proscar’ is available as blue, apple shaped tablets, each containing 5 mg finasteride.     Other ingredients   Docasate sodium BP, Hydroxypropyl cellulose EP, Hypromellose EP, Indigo carmine aluminium lake E132, Lactose EP, Magnesium stearate EP, Microcrystalline cellulose E460, Pregelatinised maize starch BP, Sodium starch glycollate BP, Talc EP, Titanium dioxide E171, Yellow iron oxide E172.   ‘Proscar’ tablets are supplied in blister packs of 28 tablets.    HOW DOES 'PROSCAR' WORK?   ‘Proscar’ belongs to a group of medicines called 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. It works by shrinking the enlarged prostate gland in men.     WHO MAKES YOUR TABLETS?   Your tablets are made by Merck Manufacturing Division, Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited, Shotton Lane, Cramlington, Northumberland UK, for Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited, Hertford Road, Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, UK, who hold the Product Licence in the UK.     WHY DO YOU NEED TO TAKE ‘PROSCAR’?   Your doctor has prescribed ‘Proscar’ for you because you have a condition known as benign prostate hyperplasia or BPH. Your prostate gland, which is near your bladder, has become bigger and is making it more difficult for you to pass water.   ‘Proscar’ helps to shrink the enlarged prostate and relieves your symptoms,        What is the prostate?   The prostate is a walnut-sized gland found only in men. It is located below the bladder and it surrounds the urethra, a tube that carries urine from the bladder out through the tip of the penis (see diagram). The prostate’s main function is to produce fluid for semen, the fluid that carries sperm.     What is BPH?   BPH is a benign enlargement of the prostate gland which is common in men over 50 years old. Because the prostate is close to the bladder and surrounds part of the urethra, its enlargement may affect your ability to urinate. You may experience such symptoms as a need to urinate often, especially at night, a feeling that you must urinate right away, difficulty in starting to urinate, a weak or interrupted urinary stream, or a feeling that you cannot empty your bladder completely.   If left untreated, BPH can lead to serious problems, including urinary tract infections and the inability to pass urine at all. For this reason, a man with symptoms of BPH should see his doctor.    ARE THERE PATIENTS WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE THESE TABLETS?    Yes, do not take these tablets if you are allergic to any of the ingredients.   The condition for which ‘Proscar’ is prescribed occurs only in men.   The tablets must not be taken by women or children.      WHAT ELSE SHOULD YOU KNOW     BEFORE TAKING 'PROSCAR'?   BPH is   not   cancer and does not lead to cancer, but the two conditions can be present at the same time. Before starting you on ' Proscar', it is likely that your doctor will perform some simple tests to check whether you have prostate cancer. Your doctor will evaluate your symptoms and their possible causes. Talk to your doctor if you have any questions.   'Proscar' is for use in men only. However, it is very important that women who are already pregnant, or who could become pregnant, should not be exposed to 'Proscar', either by handling broken or crushed tablets or through sexual contact with a man taking Proscar, since the normal development of the sex organs of a male baby (exposed prior to birth) could be affected. Therefore, if your sexual partner is or may become pregnant you must avoid exposing her to your semen which could contain a tiny amount of the drug - for example, by using a condom during sexual activity. Whole 'Proscar' Tablets are coated to prevent contact. If you are unsure about this or if it will be a problem for you, talk to your doctor before taking the tablets     CAN YOU TAKE 'PROSCAR' WITH OTHER MEDICINES?   'Proscar' does not usually interfere with other medicines. However, you should always tell your doctor about all medicines you are taking or planning to take, including any obtained without a prescription.    HOW SHOULD YOU TAKE 'PROSCAR'?    You should take your tablets exactly as your doctor has told you. The dose is 1 tablet containing 5 mg finasteride to be taken by mouth once a day with or without food.   In order to treat your symptoms and control your BPH effectively, it is important that you continue to take 'Proscar' for as long as your doctor prescribes, even if you do not feel an immediate benefit. Some patients show early improvement in symptoms, but you may need to take 'Proscar' for at least six months to see if 'Proscar' helps you. 'Proscar' works best when taken long term.     WHAT IF YOU FORGET TO TAKE A TABLET OR TAKE TOO MANY?   If you miss a dose, just carry on with the next one as usual. Do not take an extra tablet to make up. If you take too many tablets by mistake, contact your doctor immediately     WHAT UNWANTED EFFECTS COULD 'PROSCAR' HAVE?    Like any medicine, 'Proscar' may have unintended or unwanted effects. These are uncommon and do not affect most men. Some men may notice changes in their sex lives - for example, impotence (an inability to have an erection) or decreased sex drive. Some men may have a decrease in the amount of semen released during sex. This does not appear to interfere with normal sexual function. In some men, such side effects disappear with time, even if 'Proscar' is continued .   In rare cases, .some men have reported breast swelling and/or tenderness, or allergic reactions such as lip swelling and rash.    If you experience these or any other unusual symptoms, go and see your doctor promptly   It will help if you make a note of what you experienced. when it started and how long it lasted.   If symptoms persist, they usually resolve upon discontinuing 'Proscar'.    HOW SHOULD YOUR TABLETS BE KEPT?    Keep your tablets out of the reach of children.   Store them in a dry place below 30ºC and protect from light.   Do not put the tablets into another container, they might get mixed up. If you have been given a calendar pack, do not remove the tablets from the blister until you are ready to take the medicine.

"    GlucaGen™ KIT 1 mg What you should know about GlucaGen™ Kit 1 mg   Please read this carefully before using this medicine. This leaflet provides a summary of the information available on the medicine. If you have any questions or are not sure about anything, ask your doctor or pharmacist.   The name of this medicine is GlucaGen™ Kit 1 mg (Powder for injection with accompanying diluent for preparation of Glucagon Injection BP). It contains Glucagon (rys) which is identical to the glucagon produced by the human pancreas. Glucagon increases blood sugar levels and is used for the treatment of acute hypoglycaemic reactions (""hypo"" or low blood sugar) which may occur in diabetics taking insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents.    Instructions for Reconstitution           Push the orange plastic cap off the vial. Pull the needle cover off the syringe, and insert the needle through the rubber disc of the vial. Inject all the liquid from the syringe into the vial.     Without withdrawing the syringe and needle gently shake the vial until the GlucaGen is completely dissolved and the solution is clear.     Ensure that the plunger is completely depressed. Withdraw all of the solution back into the syringe. Be careful that the plunger is not pulled out of the syringe.     The solution is used for injection. Ensure there is no air remaining in the syringe before giving the injection. When the patient responds administer oral carbohydrate (eg dextrosol sweet biscuits o; a sweet drink) to prevent a further ""hypo""    Things to remember about GlucaGen™       GlucaGen™ is given by injection  . Give the injection as directed by the prescribing doctor and read the instructions below for preparation of the solution      GlucaGen™ sometimes causes problems.   You can find these listed below     *      **   More detailed information about GlucaGen™ is given below.   GlucaGen™ is used for the treatment of acute hypoglycaemic reactions (""hypo"" or low blood sugar) which may occur in diabetics taking insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents.   The glucagon acts by releasing sugar into the blood stream from glycogen stored in the liver.   GlucaGen™ is also used in hospitals to temporarily stop movement of the bowels during examinations of the gastrointestinal tract by radiography or endoscopy.       Giving the medicine      GlucaGen™ is given by injection; it may be given subcutaneously, intramuscularly or intravenously.     GlucaGen™ is contra-indicated in patients with known or suspected phaeochromocytoma, insulinoma or glucagonoma.     The vial containing GlucaGen™ has a protective, tamper-evident plastic cap. This must be pushed off before use. The cap cannot be replaced once it has been taken off. If the cap is not securely fastened to a new vial, the pack should be returned to the pharmacy.     Before injection, a solution of GlucaGen™ must be prepared using the diluent provided in the pack. Carefully read the Instructions for Reconstitution.     Following reconstitution, if the solution is not clear (solid particles or particles with the appearance of fibres are present), it must not be used for injection.       Treatment of Acute Hypoglycaemia     Glucagon is often prescribed for treatment of hypoglycaemia so that close friends or relatives can give the injection if you become hypoglycaemic and are unable to take sugar by mouth. In this case it is important to follow your doctor's instructions on how to give the injection .     Follow your doctor's instructions concerning the appropriate dose for treating hypoglycaemia. [The recommended dose for treatment of hypoglycaemia in diabetes (adults and children) is 0.5 to 1 mg (20 microgram/kg)].     Following injection of glucagon, carbohydrate must be given (eg glucose tablets or sugar) by mouth as soon as sufficient recovery has taken place. This will restore the stored sugar (glycogen) in the liver, and prevent the blood sugar falling again.     If recovery has not taken place within 10 minutes of the glucagon injection a doctor must be called immediately so that intravenous glucose can be given.       Use in Radiography or Endoscopy   The dose ranges from 0.2 to 2 mg depending on the diagnostic techniques used and the route of administration. The usual diagnostic dose for relaxation of the stomach, duodenal bulb, duodenum and small bowel is 0.2 to 0.5 mg given intravenously or 1 mg given intramuscularly; the usual dose to relax the colon is 0.5 to 0.75 mg intravenously or 1 to 2 mg intramuscularly.      * Possible problems with GlucaGen  * Possible problems with      Glucagon has relatively few and minor side effects consisting mainly of nausea and vomiting, especially when the dose is more than 1 mg.     Glucagon has an opposite effect to insulin on blood sugar levels.     Caution must be observed if GlucaGen™ is used in diabetics as an adjunct in radiography or endoscopy of the gastro-intestinal tract. Since Glucagon is a protein, there is theoretical possibility of hypersensitivity.      Use during pregnancy and lactation   Glucagon does not cross the placenta. Experience of the use of glucagon during pregnancy is limited to the treatment of hypoglycaemia in a small number of pregnant diabetics; in this group all pregnancies were completed successfully and there was no evidence of harmful effects on the infants.      **Storage of GlucaGen™ Kit      Store your packs of GlucaGen™ Kit in a refrigerator at 2° to 8°C.     A pack carried for use may be kept at normal surrounding temperature (maximum 25°C) for up to 18 months.     the expiry date printed on the outside of the pack is for storage in a refrigerator.

"      WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT NIVAQUINE™ TABLETS   This leaflet should be read carefully before you start to take the tablets as it is a summary of important information about your medicine.   This leaflet also gives additional advice on how to avoid being bitten by mosquitos. If you have any questions, or are not sure about anything to do with your treatment, ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.    ABOUT THIS MEDICINE     This medicine is called NIVAQUINE (chloroquine) tablets.     Each tablet contains 200 mg of chloroquine sulphate and the following inactive ingredients: cellulose, glucose, acacia, modified starch, magnesium stearate, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, polyethylene glycol, yellow Opaspray.     Chloroquine is one of a group of medicines called anti-malarials but it is sometimes useful for other conditions also.     This package contains 28 tablets of NIVAQUINE.     The manufacturer and product licence holder of NIVAQUINE tablets is: May & Baker Limited, Rainham Road South, Dagenham, Essex RM10 7XS      Why have I been given Nivaquine Tablets?   NIVAQUINE is usually given to help prevent you getting malaria. Malaria is spread by mosquitos.   Some mosquitos carry the malaria parasites and can infect you with them if they bite you - it can take a week or more to develop malaria after an infected bite.   NIVAQVINE can help prevent you getting malaria when you have been bitten by a mosquito.   Like other similar medicines, in some cases NIVAQUINE will not give complete protection against malaria. It is, therefore, important you follow all other medical advice.   Make sure that you have told your doctor or pharmacist which countries you are visiting. In some parts of the world the malaria parasites are not affected by chloroquine.   If you have been given another anti-malarial medicine to take with NIVAQUINE, then you must follow the separate directions for it.   Sometimes your doctor may have prescribed NIVAQUINE for treating other conditions. Please contact your doctor if this is the case.   If you are already taking NIVAQUINE or medicines called ""Avloclor"" or ""PIaquenil"" for another condition consult your doctor.    Keep this leaflet for reference until you have finished taking the medicine.      Before taking your Nivaquine Tablets   If the answer is YES to any of the following questions you should discuss the matter with your doctor or pharmacist before taking any of the tablets.     Are you taking any other medicine?     Are you pregnant or think you may be pregnant or are you trying to become pregnant?      NIVAQUINE is a trade mark59/69/16 (Smaller than original)       Are you breast feeding your baby?     Do you have any of the following illnesses - liver or kidney illness, epilepsy, psoriasis, blood disorders or neurological disorder?     Have you ever had a severe or allergic reaction to NIVAQUINE or chloroquine on taking it before?     Is the user a child under 12 years old?     Even if you are breast feeding and taking NIVAQUINE this will not protect your baby against malaria. It is important that you discuss this with your doctor.      How should I take my NIVAQUINE Tablets?   It is very important that you take your NIVAQUINE tablets properly.   If you do not take enough, you have a greater risk of developing malaria.    If you take too much, you may develop side effects  .     Take the tablets with a glass of water     Do not chew the tablets     If possible, start by taking 2 NIVAQUINE tablets 1 week before entering a country in which malaria may be present.     If you cannot take NIVAQUINE TABLETS before entering the country take 2 tablets as soon as you arrive     The next dose is 2 tablets taken one week after the first dose. Don't worry if that seems a long time between doses. NIVAQUINE remains in the body for a long time.      Do not be tempted to take the tablets more often unless your Doctor or Pharmacist tells you to.      whilst you are away take 2 tablets on the same day each week     If you think you will have a problem remembering to take the tablets ask a friend or relative to remind you. Writing the day you should take the dose in your diary or on a calendar may help jog your memory.      When you arrive home continue to take 2 tablets once a week for 4 weeks. You must remember to keep taking the tablets when you are at home - even If you fed perfectly well. Malaria can develop some time after being bitten by a mosquito. If you stop taking the tablets this will increase the risk of developing malaria when you are at home.      If you forget to take your tablets take them immediately you remember and then continue as before.     If your doctor has prescribed another medicine to help prevent malaria you may need to take this medicine more often than NIVAQUINE. Follow the instructions carefully.      If you have to take NIVAQUINE for a long period of time, for example a year or more, consult your doctor who may decide to carry out a few simple tests on you.        What other measures must I take to reduce the risk of developing Malaria?   Like other anti-malarial medicines, NIVAQUINE does not give guaranteed complete protection against malaria.      You should also try to avoid being bitten by mosquitos by doing the following:     Remember that the risks of being bitten by a mosquito are much greater in a rural, rather than a built-up area You can reduce the risk of being bitten in a rural area by visiting only in the day, when mosquitos rarely bite.     Use insect repellent on exposed skin between dusk and dawn.     Wear long-sleeved clothing and long trousers after sunset, avoiding dark colours as these attract mosquitos.     Wear repellent-soaked wrist or ankle bands between dusk and dawn.     If your accommodation is not protected against mosquitos by, for example, screened windows and doors and/or air conditioning then do the following:     When entering a room at night use a fly killer spray to kill any mosquitos which have entered the room.     Always sleep under a mosquito net. Make sure that there are no holes in the net and that it is tucked in under the mattress. You can increase the effect of the net by soaking it in an insecticide such as permethrin.     If you think mosquitos can enter your room at night, use an electric mosquito killer or burn a 'mosquito coil'. Mosquito 'buzzers' are not effective.     Advice on the above can be obtained from your doctor or pharmacist before you leave home. In the countries you are visiting you should obtain information and supplies from a local pharmacist.   In the UK further information and supplies can be obtained by telephoning the Medical Advisory Service for Travellers Abroad (MASTA) on O71 631 4408. The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine has a 24 hour recorded help line on 0891 600 350 and recorded advice on preventing mosquito bites on 0891 6C0 274 (calls are charged at 48p per minute at peak rate and 36p per minute at other times).     How can I tell if I may have developed Malaria?   If any of the following symptoms develop when you are away or within 1 year of arriving home:   High temperature with chills, shivering or sweating, Headache, diarrhoea, other 'flu-like' symptoms, or, if you have any concern about your health you should contact a doctor.     What should I do if I think I may have developed Malaria?      Immediately seek medical attention. Delay can be dangerous.      If you have returned home visit your doctor immediately. It is very important that you tell your doctor that you have recently returned from abroad. Tell your doctor which countries you have visited and what medicines you have taken.     If you cannot see your usual doctor go immediately to the casualty department of your local hospital and tell them the above information.      The early stage of malaria is easily treated but delay In seeking medical attention can make it very difficult to treat and may be fatal.         What should I do if I accidentally take too many tablets or a young child swallows some tablets?   If you have taken too many tablets or you think that a young child has taken some accidentally :      Immediately tell your doctor or visit the nearest hospital casualty department.      Emergency treatment may be required in such cases, as NIVAQUINE overdosage can be dangerous, especially in children.     Do   not   use salt to make your child sick - it may make him worse.       Do NIVAQUINE Tablets have Side Effects?   As well as benefits most medicines may have unwanted effects in some people. The following minor side effects of NIVAQUINE are well known. You need not worry about them unless they become troublesome:     headachel     Shortly after taking NIVAQUINE your eyesight may become blurred. If you are affected in this way make sure that you do not drive a car or operate machinery until this effect has disappeared - usually within 24 hours.    The following are serious side effects and you should tell your doctor or pharmacist about them immediately.    skin trouble such as rash or itching psoriasis may worsen severe stomach upset blurred eyesight which lasts for more than 2 days convulsions loss of hair   If they occur before you leave home your doctor or pharmacist may be able to recommend an alternative medicine.    If you have any problems which you think may be caused by NIVAQVINE see a doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible      How should I store NIVAQUINE Tablets?     NIVAQUINE tables can be dangerous when not used correctly, especially to young children, and should be kept in a safe place.     Keep your tablets in the strip pack in the box     Keep them in a cool, dry place away from light     When you have finished a course of treatment return any unused tablets to a pharmacist who will arrange for them to be destroyed. Do not give this medicine to others - it may be harmful to them.       How can I tell if my NIVAQUINE Tablets can still be used?     All medicines have an expiry date.     The expiry date of NIVAQUINE tablets is printed on the end flap of the NIVAQUINE tablet carton.     The expiry date follows an 'EXP’ printed on the flap.

TAKING YOUR MEDICINE Operating instructions   Before using Rhinocort Aqua nasal spray for the first time shake the bottle and pump several times (5 - 10 times) into the air so that a uniform mist is obtained (see picture).    The loading effect remains for approximately 24 hours.  If a longer period of time passes before the next dose is taken, the pump must be loaded again.  This time it is sufficient to pump just once (1) into the air.             Blow your nose. Shake the bottle. Remove the protective cap.      Hold the bottle as shown in the pictures .      Insert the tip into the nostril and pump the number of doses prescribed.  Administer the spray into the other nostril in the same way.       Replace the protective cap.  Keep the bottle in an upright position.  Do not use Rhinocort Aqua nasal spray more often than prescribed.       –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––       It is important to take your medicine at the right times.  You must take it as directed by your doctor.  The label will tell you how much to take and how often.  Usually this will be once a day or sometimes twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.  If you forget to take a dose take one as soon as you remember and then carry on as before.  If it is very close to the next dose time before you remember, wait until then.  Rhinocort Aqua may take a few days before the full effect can be felt.    During this time the symptoms of hay fever or rhinitis should become less.    You may notice that at first you will sneeze soon after the spray is used.  This is because the lining of the nose is very sensitive.  This does not happen after the first few doses.  This medicine can sometimes cause side-effects in some people.  If you get slight bleeding from your nose or if you notice anything else unusual when using Rhinocort Aqua, tell your doctor.         ",
"    Cordarone X Intravenous amiodarone hydrochloride    Presentation Ampoules for intravenous injection clear, pale yellow solution containing 150mg amiodarone hydrochloride in 3ml Indications    Treatment should be initiated only under hospital or specialist supervision. Tachyarrhythmias associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. All types of tachyarrhythmias including; supraventricular, nodal and ventricular tachycardias; atrial flutter and fibrillation; ventricular fibrillation; when other drugs cannot be used.    Dosage and Administration   Cordarone X Intravenous should only be used when facilities exist for cardiac monitoring or defibrillation, should the need arise.   The standard recommended dose is 5mg/kg bodyweight given by intravenous infusion over a period of 20 minutes to two hours Where possible this should be administered as a dilute solution in 250ml 5% dextrose.   This may be followed by repeat infusions up to 1200mg, (i.e. approximately 15mg/kg bodyweight) in up to 500ml 5% dextrose per 24 hours, the rate of infusion being adjusted on the basis of clinical response.   In extreme clinical emergency the drug may, at the discretion of the clinician, be given as a slow injection of 150-300mg in 10 20ml of 55/O dextrose over a minimum of three minutes This should not be repeated for at least 15 minutes. Patients treated in this way must be closely monitored. eg in an intensive care unit When given by infusion Cordarone X may reduce drop size and if appropriate, adjustment should be made to the rate of infusion   Repeated or continuous infusion via the peripheral veins may lead to local discomfort and inflammation When repeated or continuous infusion is anticipated, administration by a central venous catheter is recommended.   Oral therapy should be initiated concomitantly at the usual loading dose i.e. 200mg three times a day, as soon as possible after an adequate response has been obtained using Cordarone X Intravenous which should then be phased out gradually Whilst there is no evidence that dosage requirements are different in the elderly they may be more susceptible to bradycardia and conduction defects if too high a dosage is employed Particular attention should be paid to monitoring of thyroid function   For directions on oral therapy, please refer to the Data Sheet Product Information Sheet.    Contraindications, Warnings, etc   Cordarone X Intravenous is contra-indicated in severe respiratory failure, circulatory collapse and severe arterial hypotension and may cause moderate and transient reduction in blood pressure. Circulatory collapse may be precipitated by too rapid an administration or overdosage (atropine has been used successfully in such patients presenting with bradycardia) Cordarone X is contra indicated in patients with sinus bradycardia and sino-atrial heart block. In patients with severe conduction disturbances (high grade AV block, bifascicular or trifascicular block) or sinus node disease Cordarone X should be used only in conjunction with a pacemaker   Cordarone X is contra-indicated in patients with evidence or a history of thyroid dysfunction In doubtful cases thyroid function tests should be performed prior to therapy with Cordarone X.   One ampoule of Cordarone X Intravenous contains approximately 56mg Iodine. Caution is therefore advised when considering administration to patients with known hypersensitivity to Iodine.   Congestive heart failure is also a contraindication when using Cordarone X Intravenous as a bolus injection Oral Cordarone X is not contra-indicated in patients with latent or manifest heart failure, but caution should be exercised as existing heart failure may occasionally be worsened by Cordarone X. In this case, Cordarone X should be associated with the usual cardiotonic and diuretic treatment   Too high a dosage may lead to severe bradycardia and to conduction disturbances with the appearance of an idioventricular rhythm, particularly in elderly patients or during digitalis therapy. In these circumstances, Cordarone X treatment should be withdrawn. If necessary ß-adrenostimulants or glucagon may be given.     Side Effects   Rapid administration of Cordarone X Intravenous has been associated with anaphylactic shock, hot flushes, sweating and nausea In cases of respiratory failure. notably in asthmatics, bronchospasm and/or apnoea may also occur.   Bradycardia which is generally moderate and dose dependent has been reported In some cases (sinus node disease, elderly patients) marked bradycardia or more exceptionally sinus arrest has occurred. There have been rare instances of conduction disturbances (sino-atrial block, various degrees of AV block).   Cordarone X has a low proarrhythmic effect This has usually occurred in combination with other precipitating factors particularly other antiarrhythmic agents, hypokalaemia and digoxin   Both hyper and hypothyroidism have occurred during, or soon after, treatment with Cordarone X Simple monitoring of the usual biochemical tests is confusing because some (PBI and 131I uptake) are invalidated and others (T4, T3 and FTI) may be altered where the patient is clearly euthyroid. Clinical monitoring is therefore recommended and should be continued for some months after discontinuation of Cordarone X treatment. This is particularly important in the elderly. In patients whose history indicates an increased risk of thyroid dysfunction, regular testing is recommended.   Diffuse pulmonary alveolitis and fibrosis have been reported. Patients developing dyspnoea without signs of cardiac failure or loss of control of arrhythmias should be carefully evaluated clinically including chest X ray and lung function testing.    It is advisable to monitor liver function particularly transaminases before treatment and periodically thereafter   At the beginning of therapy, elevation of serum transaminases which can be in isolation (1.5 to 3 times normal) may occur. These may return to normal with dose reduction, or sometimes spontaneously. Occasional cases of acute liver disorders with elevated serum transaminases and/or jaundice may occur. These normally regress when treatment is withdrawn. During long term therapy, there have been reports of chronic liver disease.   Patients on continuous therapy may develop microdeposits in the cornea. Rare cases of impaired visual acuity due to optic neuritis have been reported Cordarone X may induce photosensitization in some patients Rarely a slate grey or bluish discolouration of the skin has occurred Skin rashes including isolated cases of exfoliative dermatitis have been reported Cases of erythema have been reported during radiotherapy   Peripheral neuropathy and/or myopathy, nightmares, vertigo, headaches, sleeplessness, tremor, ataxia and benign raised intracranial pressure have been reported.   Other unwanted effects reported include nausea, vomiting, metallic taste, fatigue, epididymo-orchitis and hypersensitivity reactions including vasculitis, renal involvement or thrombocytopenia.    Drug Interactions   Administration of Cordarone X to a patient already receiving digoxin may bring about an increase in the plasma digoxin concentration and thus precipitate symptoms and signs associated with high digoxin levels Monitoring is recommended and digoxin dosage should be adjusted accordingly. A synergistic effect on heart rate and atrioventricular conduction is also possible It may potentiate oral anticoagulant therapy by increasing plasma levels of oral anticoagulants. More frequent monitoring of prothrombin time during treatment with and after discontinuation of Cordarone X therapy is indicated Consideration should be given to the possibility that Cordarone X may alter the plasma concentrations of other drugs particularly those which are highly protein bound eg phenytoin   Potentiation of the negative chronotropic and dromotropic properties of beta blockers and certain calcium channel inhibitors (verapamil, diltiazem) may occur. Combination therapy should therefore be strictly monitored.   The risk of Torsade de Pointes may be increased when Cordarone X is used in combination with other drugs which directly or indirectly prolong the QT interval eg certain antiarrhythmics (quinidine, disopyramide) or agents which may induce hypokalaemia eg diuretics.   The combination of Cordarone X with other antiarrhythmics (especially Class I) needs particularly careful consideration.   Cordarone X should not be used with sotalol because of the effects on repolarization.   Potentially severe complications have been reported in patients taking amiodarone undergoing general anaesthesia: bradycardia unresponsive to atropine, hypotension, disturbances of conduction, decreased cardiac output. A few cases of acute respiratory distress have been observed in the period immediately after cardiovascular surgery. Possible potentiation of the toxic effect of oxygen has been implicated The anaesthetist should be informed that the patient is taking Cordarone X    Women of Child-Bearing Age:   Although no teratogenic effects have been observed in animals, there are insufficient data on the use of Cordarone X during pregnancy in humans to judge any possible toxicity However, in view of the pharmacological properties of the drug on the foetus and its effect on the foetal thyroid gland, its administration in pregnancy should be avoided Breastfeeding is contraindicated Pharmaceutical Precautions Ampoules should be protected from light Cordarone X Intravenous is incompatible with saline and should be administered solely in 5% Dextrose solution Solutions containing less than two ampoules Cordarone X Intravenous in 500ml Dextrose 5% are unstable and should not be used Name and Address of Product Licence/Product Authorisation Holder       Sanofi UK Ltd Manchester M23 9NF Telephone: 061945 4161 Made in England     Distributed in the Republic of Ireland by:     Cahill May Roberts Chapelizod Dublin 20      Further Information   Cordarone X Intravenous may be used prior to DC cardioversion. It has been used to treat successfully atrial, junctional and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. It may be used where a rapid response is required, such as following a myocardial infarction Cordarone X induces ECG changes; QT interval lengthening corresponding to prolonged repolarisation; U and deformed T waves may occur because of the fixing of amiodarone in myocardial tissues.

Scabies is caused by a mite called   Sarcoptes scabiei  . The female mite burrows into the outer layers of the skin to lay its eggs. The female mite is larger than the male and is just visible to the naked eye {0 4 x 0 3mm).   The female mite feeds on skin cells as she burrows and lays her eggs behind her.   This burrowing into the skin is usually painless; at this stage the infection is not noticed.   The intense itch and rash of scabies is caused by an allergic reaction to the mites, their droppings or their dead bodies.   The scabies itch often takes 3 - 4 weeks to develop and is often worst at night. The itch usually occurs on the hands, arms, legs, inner thighs and around the waist. However the mites themselves are found on and between the fingers, on the wrists, feet, toes, ankles, elbows, knees, arm-pits genitals and buttocks. In women, the breasts may also be affected.   In adults the face and neck are hardly ever affected, but scabies can affect the faces of babies.   The skin can become raised and red at the site of each mite; this is most common on the fingers.   These lesions are often made worse by scratching and secondary infection.     How is scabies caught?   The scabies mite is transmitted by direct and prolonged skin contact (for example holding hands). It is commonly passed between family members and partners sharing the same bed, or any other intimate personal contact. Scabies cannot be caught from bed linen or clothing.     Treatment   Treatment of scabies is simple and effective. The treatment is applied to the whole body from the neck down, and all family members should be treated at the same time. Babies and children under 2 years should also have their necks, faces, ears and scalps treated. You should not have a bath before treatment; in fact, treatment should be to clean but cool skin. Ideally, someone else should apply the treatment, so that the whole body surface is covered. Try to ensure that the cream is applied systematically so that no patches of skin are missed. Remember to treat the palms of hands and soles of feet, in between fingers and toes, and underneath finger and toe nails.   After treatment the itch may remain or increase for a while but will go away gradually after 1 - 2 weeks, when all of the dead mites have been rubbed off along with the outer layers of the skin. The itching can be relieved by using Calamine lotion or anti-histamine tablets/syrup.   It is not necessary to boil wash underwear, nightwear or bed linen. The normal washing procedure should be followed for these items after treatment    Remember:   This treatment is for YOU. Only a doctor can prescribe it for you. Never give it to others. It may harm them even if their symptoms are the same as yours.   The Product Licence for Lyclear Dermal Cream is held by The Wellcome Foundation Limited, London NW1 2BP.

"      This inhaler is designed for use with a medicine called Ventolin Rotacaps.  This leaflet shows you how to load your inhaler and how to use it.  If there is anything which you do not understand or are not sure about, ask your doctor or pharmacist.   Ventolin Rotacaps should only be used with a Ventolin Rotahaler Inhaler.    Keep all medicines out of the reach of children  .   These instructions have been devised in agreement with the National Asthma Campaign 300 Upper Street, London N1 2XX, Tel: 071–226 2260 and The British Lung Foundation, 250 Kings Road   London SW3 5UE, Tel: 071–376 5735.      HOW TO USE YOUR ROTAHALER               Remove the Rotahaler from its box.  Check that the mouthpiece is clean.  Hold the Rotahaler by the mouthpiece and twist the barrel in either direction until it stops.             Hold the Rotahaler level with the white dot upwards.  Twist the barrel the other way as far as it will go.  You should hear a click as the capsule breaks open.  The Rotahaler is now ready to use.            Keep the Rotahaler level    and raise it to your mouth.  Place the mouthpiece between your teeth and close your lips firmly around it   but do not bite it.        Breathe out as far as is comfortable and then....            Breathe in through your mouth as quickly and deeply as possible.      Hold your breath and remove the Rotahaier from your mouth.  Continue holding your breath for as long as is comfortable.        AFTER USING YOUR ROTAHALER     Pull the two halves of the Rotahaler apart and throw away the U empty half of the capsule.  Unless you are going to clean the Rotahaler, leave the half that is still in the ""square"" hole.     Put the two halves of the Rotahaler back together so that the white dot faces the words on the barrel.  IF YOUR DOCTOR HAS TOLD YOU TO USE A SECOND CAPSULE REPEAT STEPS 2 TO 9.     Always put the Rotahaler back into its box to keep out dust and fluff.  Do not load a new capsule until you need to use your Rotahaler again.      IMPORTANT   To help your treatment to work it is important to breathe in through your mouth both   quickly and deeply.    If you are doing this correctly you will hear the empty half of the capsule rattling inside the Rotahaler.     CLEANING   Clean your Rotahaler at least once a week.     Pull the two halves apart.     Remove the empty capsule shell if there is one.     Wash in warm water and leave to dry in a warm place. Avoid excessive heat.     A mild detergent or a solution of the type used to clean babies' feeding bottles may be added to the water (your pharmacist will be able to advise you).  Then rinse thoroughly with clean water before drying and putting back together.     STORAGE   Always store your Rotahaler in its box to keep it clean.  You will need a new Rotahaler after about 6 months.   Ventolin, Rotahaler and Rotacaps are trade marks.         ",

"      Potaba Aminobenzoate Potassium USP    What is Potaba?   Potaba is part of the Vitamin B complex. It is a naturally occurring substance that participates in many biologically important processes.     Why is Potaba prescribed?   Potaba is prescribed for conditions such as scleroderma and Peyronie’s disease. It is believed to produce a skin/plaque softening in patients when given in adequate dosage over sufficient time.     How does it work?   Understanding of drug mechanism at the cellular level is incomplete in the case of many medications. It is thought that Potaba has an antifibrotic effect due to increased oxygen uptake at the tissue level.     How is it administered?   Orally, according to the schedule contained in this leaflet.     What is the advantage of taking Potaba?   Therapy with Potaba is non-toxic, low-risk treatment for conditions that are usually long-term. This regimen represents a good possibility of softening hardened tissue. As there is a very low incidence of drug interactions, many other medications may be continued while you are taking Potaba. It is highly soluble in water and therefore readily absorbed.     Where can I get Potaba?   Potaba is available on prescription from your doctor and at your local pharmacy.     Are there any contraindications to Potaba?   Your doctor should know if you are taking antimicrobial sulphonamides as Potaba may nullify the antibacterial effect.   Potaba should be administered with caution in the following medical conditions:   Diabetes mellitus (sugar diabetes) Hypoglycaemia (chronic low blood sugar) Allergy to Potaba or PABA Kidney disease     How long should I take Potaba? How soon will I see results?   Length of therapy varies considerably with disease state and from person to person. It may be two to three months before results are noticeable.     Are there foods, drink or activities I should avoid while taking Potaba?   Potaba therapy is most acceptable when taken in conjunction with meals or snacks. There are no  specific foods to avoid, but it is good to keep a normal dietary intake to prevent stomach upset or low blood sugar. The doctor should know if you are on a special diet. Usual activities can be encouraged. If you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or nursing an infant your doctor should be notified so this can be taken into consideration when prescribing Potaba or any prescription medication.     Are there any side effects?   Anorexia, nausea, fever and rash occurred rarely.     What should I do if these symptoms occur?      and resume therapy.      Desensitization schedules are available from Glenwood Ltd.       Are there any other considerations before beginning Potaba therapy?   With   any   prescription drug it is wise to consider:   The prescription is for the specific condition and for the use of the patient only.   Keep medicine out of reach of children.   If you have questions about the information presented here, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.     How to take Potaba   Potaba is taken four times a day after meals or snacks. If you are unable to eat, omit dosage until eating again.   Potaba is supplied in three dosage forms: Envules, Capsules and Tablets. Changing dosage form may prevent medication burn-out. (Medication burn-out is a term to describe a situation in which the patient stops taking medication. In consequence, the desired results of therapy will not be seen.)     Potaba Envules (3 g per pack)   Add one envelope to a glass of chilled water or juice; stir to dissolve and drink after eating.     Potaba Capsules (500 mg per capsule)   Take six capsules after eating with a glass of water.     Potaba Tablets (500 mg per tablet)   CRUSH six tablets and add to a glass of chilled water or juice; stir thoroughly and drink after eating.

"      Actrapid Pen   Please read this carefully before you start to take your insulin . This leaflet provides a summary of the information available on your insulin. If you have any questions or are not sure about anything, ask your doctor or pharmacist.    The name of your insulin is: Actrapid Pen (Insulin Injection BP)   This preparation contains insulin [Human insulin (pyr)] which is identical to the insulin produced by the human pancreas. Insulin preparations supplement or replace the insulin that your own pancreas produced before you developed diabetes. They allow your body to continue converting the carbohydrates you eat into energy.    Things to remember about Actrapid Pen    Take your insulinTake your       *     **     More detailed information about Actrapid Pen is given below.   Actrapid Pen is used for the treatment of insulin-requiring diabetics. It is a disposable dial-a-dose insulin delivery device (""Pen""), able to deliver 2-78 units in increments of 2 units and containing a neutral solution of human insulin (pyr). The insulin preparation in this device (Insulin Injection) is a short-acting insulin; it is a clear liquid.       Taking your insulin      Before taking your insulin, be sure you do not have hypoglycaemia, i.e. low blood sugar or 'hypo-. You must not take insulin if you have hypoglycaemia (see *Possible Problems).     Be sure your insulin is the same as usual; changes in type of insulin without your doctors knowledge can cause problems such as hypoglycaemia.   It is important to take your insulin at the right times. Take it as advised by your doctor. If you are unsure of anything ask your doctor.   Before each injection make sure the injection site is clean. Injections should not be given at exactly the same place each time, as they might cause fatty lumps to develop at the injection site. This may affect your diabetic control.   Carefully read the Instructions for Use, below, before using your Pen.   Always perform an ""air shot"" prior to each injection, this will release any air which may have collected and ensures the correct functioning of the Pen.   The insulin injection is usually given subcutaneously. Follow your doctors instructions concerning injection techniques.      Pregnancy   If you are pregnant consult your doctor immediately. If you are planning to become pregnant, consult your doctor well in advance to discuss your diabetic control and insulin requirements.     Illness   Illness is likely to alter (usually increase) your insulin requirements and your dose may need to be adjusted. Do not stop taking your insulin even if you are eating much less than normal.    Other medicines   Other medicines can affect your diabetic control. If you start on corticosteroids, oral contraceptives (the ""pill"") or thyroid hormone replacement therapy you may require more insulin, whereas if you start on monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI; some medicines used for the treatment of depression) or beta blockers (medicines used for treating high blood pressure, heart disease and glau-  coma) you may require less insulin. Beta blockers may also blur the symptoms of hypoglycaemia. Always notify your doctor if you are taking any other medicines, even if obtained without a prescription.     Exercise   If you take physical exercise you will probably need to lower your insulin dose. Get advice from your doctor and always have extra carbohydrate (sugar or glucose tablets) available. The effect of exercise on your blood sugar can last for many hours after you have actually stopped exercising.     Driving or operating machinery   Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) can seriously impair your ability to drive or operate machinery. You should discuss with your doctor whether it is safe for you to drive or operate machinery, particularly if you have just started on insulin, if you have difficulty recognising the symptoms of hypoglycaemia, or if you have recently experienced changes in your diabetic control. Never drive or operate machinery for more than 2 hours without a break for a snack.     Alcohol   Remember, alcohol should be taken with caution as it may lead to hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Never drink alcohol on an empty stomach.    *Possible problems with insulin treatment Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar)   It is important not to let your blood sugar levels fall too low. You should always carry some form of sugar with you .   Low blood sugar levels or hypo's can be caused by:     Too much insulin     Eating too little or missing a meal     Unplanned exercise     Drinking alcohol     Some medicines     Because of its strong initial effect, the injection of Actrapid Pen should be followed by a meal within approximately 30 minutes of giving it, to avoid hypoglycaemia.   The symptoms of low blood sugar differ from one person to another and you will learn to recognise your own symptoms. Early symptoms and signs often include: sweating, shakiness, mood changes, and paleness. If blood sugar levels fall even lower, this may cause tiredness, dizziness, faintness, hunger and tingling in the hands and feet.   If your doctor has asked you to intensify your insulin treatment in order to improve your blood sugar levels, you may at some point lose some of the warning symptoms (such as shakiness, pounding heart beat, sweating and feeling anxious) which usually occur when your blood sugar is falling too low (hypoglycaemia). In this case it is important to think carefully about the timing of your meals, to bear in mind the exercise you take, and to keep a close watch on your blood sugar by frequent blood glucose testing. This is particularly important if you are driving.      Treatment of hypoglycaemia   If you feel you may be suffering a hypo you should, without delay eat food containing carbohydrate, preferably as glucose tablets or sugar. If low blood glucose is not corrected this can lead to loss of consciousness. It is, therefore, important that close friends and relatives know what to do if this occurs. It is also advisable to carry or wear something stating that you are being treated with insulin.   If you lose consciousness due to hypoglycaemia your relatives or close friends may have been taught to give you a subcutaneous or intramuscular injection of glucagon. You should always take sugar or glucose on recovery. If you do not respond to glucagon or it is not available, your relatives and close friends should know to call a doctor immediately so that intravenous glucose can be given.  continued        Hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar)   This results from taking too little insulin in relation to your food intake or exercise. If your blood sugar is high you are likely to be very thirsty and will need to pass urine frequently. Prolonged high blood sugar may eventually lead to coma. If your blood sugar level rises to high levels check your urine for ketones. If ketones are present contact your doctor immediately.     Side effects   Side effects to insulin are rare. The most common is itching or redness at the site of injection. If you experience any skin reaction at the injection side, tell your doctor as soon as possible.   When insulin treatment is first started you may get swollen feet and blurred vision in the first week or so. These problems usually disappear with continued treatment; tell your doctor if they persist.     Changing to human insulin   You should only change to human insulin on your doctor’s advice.   Transfer from porcine to human insulin of the same type, does not normally require a change in dosage.   Transfer from bovine or mixed bovine/porcine insulins to human insulin may require a dosage adjustment; follow your doctors advice on this.   A few patients have reported that after being transferred to human insulin, the early warning symptoms for hypoglycaemia were less pronounced than they were with animal source insulins.    **Storage of disposable pen preparations   As with all insulin preparations, store your full packs of disposable pens, and pens not in use, in a refrigerator at 2° to 8°C, but do not allow the insulin to freeze.   Pens which are in use must not be kept in a refrigerator. Pens in use or carried as a spare can be kept at normal surrounding temperature (e.g. in the pocket or handbag) for up to one month, but should not be exposed to excessive heat or sunlight.      What's in your medicine   Actrapid Pen contains 3 ml of a solution of human insulin (pyr) in a strength of 100 iu/ml; it is a clear, colourless liquid. Actrapid Pen also contains glycerol, and m-cresol as added preservative.     Instructions for use   Please read these instructions carefully before using your disposable Pen.   Actrapid Pen must only be used with NovoFine needles.     Preparing the Pen   Check that your Pen contains the correct type of insulin. Pull off the cap.   Disinfect the rubber membrane.        Remove the protective tab from a NovoFine needle and screw the needle onto the Pen. Pull off the outer and inner needle caps.   ""Air shot"": Small amounts of air may collect in the needle and reservoir during normal use. To avoid the injection of air hold the Pen with the needle upwards and tap the reservoir gently with the finger, so any air bubbles collect in the top of the reservoir.     Keeping the Pen with the needle upwards turn the reservoir one click in the direction of the arrow.     Still with the needle upwards press the push button fully home, and see if a drop of insulin appears at the needle tip. If not, repeat the procedure until a drop of insulin is seen at the needle tip.     Some air may remain in the insulin reservoir after this but it will not be injected.      Setting the dose       Replace the cap so that   0   is opposite the dosage indicator.       Hold the Pen horizontally and turn the cap in the direction of the arrow to set the required dose.     Be careful not to put your hand over the push button when dialling the dose. If the button is not allowed to rise freely, insulin will be pushed out of the needle.   The scale on the cap shows   0, 2, 4, 6, 8,10,12,14,16   and   18   units. For every click you feel when you turn the cap 2 units are set.   As the cap is turned the push button rises. The scale under the push button shows   20, 40   and   60   units. Every time you fully turn the cap 20 units will be set      To check the dose set add the figure on the cap opposite the dosage indicator to the highest figure revealed on the push button scale.        Dosage examples   8 units:   Turn the cap until   8   is opposite the dosage indicator   52 units:   Turn the cap 2 full turns so   0   is opposite the dosage indicator again. The 40 number will show on the push button scale. Continue turning until   12   is opposite the dosage indicator (see   F  )   If you have a set a wrong dose, simply turn the cap forwards or backwards until the right number of units has been set.   78 units is the maximum dose. If you attempt to set a higher dose, excess insulin will be expelled from the needle and the dose will be wrong.   If you set more than 78 units turn the cap back as far as you can until the push button is firmly home and resistance is felt. Now start again, remembering that 78 units is the maximum dose. After the dose is set, remove the cap to make the injection.    Making the injection   Use the injection technique advised by your doctor. Deliver the dose by pressing the push button firmly home. To allow the insulin to distribute under the skin allow the needle to remain in the skin for a few seconds.   After injection the outer needle cap is replaced, the   needle is unscrewed and carefully discarded. The cap is replaced with   0   opposite the dosage indicator.     Subsequent injections   Always check that the push button is fully home. If not, turn the cap until the push button is completely down then proceed as described above 1-3.   You cannot set a dose greater than the number of units remaining in the reservoir. The indicator for remaining insulin can be used to estimate the amount of insulin still to be used, but must not be used for dose selection.   Discard the used Pen carefully, without the needle attached.     Important   Expel air before each injection, until a drop of insulin appears at the needle tip.   The needle must be removed after each injection. If it is not removed, temperature changes may expel liquid out of the needle and the insulin concentration may change.   Do not use the indicator for remaining insulin to measure the amount of insulin to be injected.    Care should be taken not to drop the Pen or subject it to impact or misuse.   Keep out of the reach of children.   Used Pens can be discarded in household waste, but do not leave the needle attached. Dispose of the needle carefully, as recommended by your doctor or diabetic clinic.      Remember   These insulin Pens have been prescribed by your doctor for your use only. They must not be used by anyone else.   Are you a member of a Diabetic Association ?

Sporanox-Pulse capsules are manufactured by Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V, Beerse, Belgium.     WHAT IS YOUR MEDICINE USED FOR?       Your doctor has prescribed Sporanox Pulse for you because you have an infection of the nails caused by fungi or yeasts.    REMEMBER   - This medicine has been prescribed for   you only. Never give it to anyone else.   It may harm them even if their symptoms are the same as yours.     WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW BEFORE YOU START YOUR TREATMENT    BEFORE TAKING ANY MEDICINE   - always inform your doctor if you are pregnant, think you might be pregnant or are trying to become pregnant.     WHEN NOT TO USE YOUR MEDICINE           Do not use Sporanox-Pulse:    if you are pregnant or could become pregnant (e.g. by not using contraception)     if you think that you may have had an allergic reaction to Sporanox-Pulse, any of the inactive ingredients, or another antifungal medicine in the past. An allergic reaction may be recognised as a rash, itching, swollen face or lips, or shortness of breath.       if you are taking a hay fever or antihistamine product containing terfenadine or astemizole.     if you are taking cisapride (a drug used for certain digestive problems) or the oral tranquillisers, midazolam or triazolam.     Inform your doctor before taking the medicine if any of the above applies to you. Your doctor will then decide whether Sporanox-Pulse is suitable for you.    SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS   Children and the elderly Sporanox-Pulse is not normally prescribed for use in children under the age of 12 or for the elderly. However, your doctor may use his judgement to Liver problems   Tell your doctor if you have, or have had a liver problem such as jaundice.   See your doctor immediately if any of the following appear during your course of treatment with Sporanox-Pulse: severe lack of appetite, feeling sick, being sick, unusual tiredness, stomach pain, unusually dark urine, or pale stools.   If you have taken Sporanox-Pulse continuously for more than one month, your doctor may want to check your liver by testing your blood.      Kidney problems   Tell your doctor if you have a kidney problem as the dose of Sporanox-Pulse may have to be changed .     Other precautions   You should also tell your doctor immediately if you have any unusual feelings of tingling, numbness or weakness, in your hands or feet whilst taking Sporanox-Pulse.    Pregnancy      Do not take Sporanox-Pulse if you are pregnant. If you are of child bearing age and could become pregnant, you should take adequate contraceptive precautions to make sure that you do not become pregnant while you are taking your medicine. As Sporanox-Pulse remains in the body for some time after you stop taking it, you should continue to use some form of contraception for one month after your treatment with Sporanox-Pulse is finished.   If you do find that you are pregnant after starting a course of Sporanox-Pulse capsules, stop taking them and tell your doctor straight away.     Breast feeding           Do not breast-feed if you are taking  Sporanox-Pulse, as small amounts of the  medicine could be present in your milk.   Ask your doctor for advice.    Other medicines      Always tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines because taking some medicines together can be harmful.   For example, you should not take Sporanox-Pulse if you are taking an antihistamine containing terfenadine or astemizole for hay fever or allergy. You should not take Sporanox-Pulse if you are taking cisapride (a drug used for certain digestive problems) or midazolam or triazolam (drugs used as sleeping pills). Your doctor will need to know if you are using the antibiotic rifampicin or antiepileptics such as phenytoin, as they may stop Sporanox-Pulse from working properly.   Your doctor may need to alter the dose of certain other medicines before you begin your course of Sporanox-Pulse. These include blood thinning agents, the heart drug digoxin and medicines known as cyclosporin A and tacrolimus which are usually given after an organ transplant. Special care is required if the tranquilliser midazolam is given intravenously during treatment with Sporanox-Pulse. Sporanox-Pulse can make the side effects of a medicine known as vincristine more severe and your doctor may need to change the dose of either or both of these medicines.   There must be sufficient stomach acid to ensure that Sporanox-Pulse is properly absorbed by the body. Therefore, medicines that neutralise stomach acid such as medicines for indigestion, stomach ulcers or heartburn, should not be taken sooner than 2 hours after Sporanox-Pulse.     HOW TO USE YOUR MEDICINE   Always take Sporanox-Pulse immediately after a meal as this helps the body absorb the medicine.   Swallow the correct number of capsules whole with some liquid.    HOW MUCH SHOULD YOU TAKE?        Your doctor will tell you how many Sporanox-Pulse capsules to take and for how long you should continue to take them. Always read the label on your medicine and follow your doctor's instructions carefully. Ask your pharmacist if you are not sure about anything.   Your doctor will probably have recommended the following treatment course with Sporanox-Pulse.   One pulse means 2 capsules of Sporanox-Pulse twice daily for 1 week. After this pulse you should stop taking Sporanox-Pulse for 3 weeks. Then the cycle is repeated, once for fingernail infections and twice for toenail infections. For toenail infections, wait 3 weeks after the second pulse before taking Sporanox-Pulse again.   It is important that you carry on taking your medicine for as long as your doctor has told you to. Do not stop your treatment just because your condition appears to have improved.     WHAT TO DO IF YOU FORGET TO TAKE YOUR MEDICINE   If you miss any capsules, take the next dose as usual and continue your course until the capsules are finished.     IF YOU TAKE TOO MUCH OF YOUR MEDICINE           If you, or anyone else, take more Sporanox-Pulse capsules than you were told to, contact your doctor or local hospital without delay.    IF YOU THINK YOUR MEDICINE MAKES YOU FEEL ILL        Occasionally the use of Sporanox-Pulse may cause minor side effects such as headache, dizziness, feeling sick, abdominal pain, upset stomach, constipation or changes in menstrual bleeding. It is unusual for people to have an allergic reaction to Sporanox- Pulse. However, if you experience a skin rash, itching, shortness of breath and/or a swollen face, stop taking Sporanox-Pulse and contact your doctor immediately.   In patients taking Sporanox-Pulse for long periods, occasionally swelling, muscle weakness, jaundice, very dark urine, pale stools, tingling sensation in the limbs and rarely hair loss have occurred. In such cases, stop taking the medication and see your doctor immediately.   If your medicine affects you in any other way, you should tell your doctor or pharmacist.   See also Special Precautions section, above.     HOW TO STORE YOUR MEDICINE         As with all medicines, Sporanox-Pulse capsules should be kept in a safe place where children cannot reach them. Store the capsules in their carton at room temperature (15°C-30°C) in a dry place and out of strong sun light. Do not use the capsules after the expiry date printed on the packaging.

Taking your medicine      Using your patches:     Always use your patches as directed by your doctor     Most women using Estraderm MX will have had a hysterectomy (an operation to remove the womb).     If you have not had a hysterectomy you will need to take another hormone called progestogen for 12 days each month.  You will probably have a ‘period’ each month towards the end of the course of progestogen. This is quite normal.   The patches should be changed twice each week, always on the same two days.  You may find it helpful to tick the box on the inside cover of the wallet for the day of the week when you apply your first Estraderm MX patch.  This then shows the two days each week when you should change your patch. When you finish on Estraderm MX pack, start the next pack straight away.  There is no need to have a break between packs.     Putting on a patch:     Remove one sachet from the box and tear it open at the notch.  Use your fingers because cutting with scissors might damage the patch inside.     Take out the patch and remove the backing by removing the (smaller) backing strip.  Then peel off the larger piece.  Try to avoid touching the adhesive Now apply the patch at once.     Stick the patch on to a hairless area of skin below the waist.  Most patients find that the buttock is the best place.  You could also try the lower back, hip, abdomen or upper thigh.    Never put a patch on or near the breasts   Choose a clean, dry area of skin.  Avoid skin which is red or irritated.  Never powder or oil your skin before putting on a patch as it may not stick properly     Place the sticky patch on the area of skin you have chosen and press it firm into position with the palm of your hand.  Pressing for 10-20 seconds or so will make it stick securely.  Run your finger around the edge of the patch to make sure that the edges stick.  Provided that you have applied the patch correctly, you can bathe, shower or swim with little risk of the patch coming off.     When the time comes to change your patch, take off the old one, fold it in half with the sticky side inwards and throw it away carefully out of the reach of children.  Remember, it will still contain some medication.     Always place your new patch an a fresh area of skin.     If you forget to change the patch at the right time, you should change it as soon as possible.  Then continue to change your patches on the usual days as normal.      After taking your medicine   These patches may sometimes cause unwanted effects in some people.  These include:     Headaches, nausea or breast tenderness     Cramping pains in calf     Feeling slightly bloated     Dizziness     Unusual weight changes or fluid retention     Trouble with your veins       Increase in blood pressure     Slight redness and itching of the skin where a patch has been.  This usually disappears within 3-4 days of taking off the patch     Breakthrough bleeding (""spotting:) between periods (if you have not had a hysterectomy)     These effects are often mild and may wear off after a few days treatment.  If they are severe or last for more than a few days, tell your doctor.  Also if your patches upset you in any other way tell your doctor.     Storing your medicine     The expiry date for these patches is given on the carton.  Do not use the patches after this date.     Store your medicine in a cool place (below 25°C) out of reach of children.  Return any unused patches to your pharmacist.       Other useful information     Sunbathing – always make sure your patch is covered by clothing.     Using a sunbed – cover up your patch as above.     Swimming – you can wear your patch beneath your swimming costume during swimming.     Never stick on a patch straight after a hot bath or shower.  Wait a while for the skin to become completely cool and dry.     If a patch comes off, apply a new patch in the usual way.  Remember to apply your next patch at the normal time.  If you have run out of patches, contact your doctor straight away.     REMEMBER: this medicine is for you.  Only a doctor can prescribe it for you.  Never give it to someone else.

Lyclear is intended for the treatment of head lice infections and, used as directed, a t 0 minute application of Lyclear Creme Rinse will kill both head lice and their eggs.     Before using- Lyclear Creme Rinse   Lyclear Creme Rinse is suitable for most people but a few people should not use it.

How to use Lyclear Creme Rinse   Lyclear Creme Rinse is for external use only and is suitable for use in adults and children over 6 months of age. The use of Lyclear Creme Rinse in children below the age of 6 months should only be on the advice of a doctor.   One bottle of Lyclear Creme Rinse is usually sufficient to treat one person with shoulder length hair of average thickness, a little more may be required d the persons hair is especially thick or long. It is unlikely that more than two bottles will be required for any one course of treatment.   If one member of the family needs treatment, it is important to check the rest of the family and treat them if necessary.   Please follow these instructions carefully:         Shampoo the hair with a mild (non conditioning) shampoo, rinse thoroughly and towel dry so that the hair remains damp.       After shaking the bottle thoroughly, apply sufficient Lyclear Creme Rinse to saturate both the hair and scalp. Particular attention should be given to the areas behind the ears and around the nape of the neck. When completed both the hair and scalp should look well coated. For the majority of individuals most of the contents of this pack will probably be required.           Leave Lyclear Creme Rinse on the hair for ten minutes, then rinse thoroughly with water and dry in the normal way.       If desired, after the final rinse and while the hair is still wet, a line toothed comb may be used to remove dead lice and eggs.       Neither Permethrin or Lyclear Creme Rinse should irritate the eyes, although care should be taken when applying. If accidental contact with the eyes does occur, rinse immediately with plenty of water. if Lyclear   Creme Rinse is accidentally swallowed by a child a doctor must be consulted immediately.   The active ingredient of Lyclear Creme Rinse (Permethrin) is unaffected by the chlorine in swimming pools, so normal swimming activities may continue after use. There is no reason to change your normal hair washing routines following treatment.   The effects of Lyclear Creme Rinse on artificial hair colourants and perms has not formally been studied Although complaints are extremely rare, it is good practice to try Lyclear Creme Rinse on a small proportion of hair lice (e.g. on the ends of some strands of hair) before applying it over the entire head and scalp.   In most cases (97-99%) a single treatment is sufficient to eliminate head lice. Lice may continue to move/twitch up to 24 hours after treatment but this is usually a sign of paralysis caused by Lyclear Creme Rinse and not a sign of treatment failure. Clinical work has shown that Lyclear Creme   Rinse may continue to have activity for up to 6 weeks following a single application.     Clinical Use   Nursing staff who routinely use Lyclear Creme Rinse may wish to wear gloves to avoid any possible irritation to the hands.     Side effects   Side-effects to Lyclear are infrequent, mild and short-lived and are generally similar to those often associated with an infection with head lice e.g. skin irritation/mild tingling or stinging. Consult your doctor of these symptoms persist or worsen, or if you have any other unusual effects, during or following the use of Lyclear Creme Rinse.     How to store Lyclear Creme Rinse     Keep the medicine tightly closed in the original container Store below 25°C and keep away from direct heat and light     Remember. as with all medicines, keep Lyclear Creme Rinse well away from children     Do not use after the last day of the expiry date shown on the pack.

Revision date: August t 995      Further Information Interesting Facts about Head Lice   It is estimated that up to halt a million children catch head lice each year. Also, as with the common cold, anyone can catch head lice. So if someone in your family catches head lice, they are not alone, and it is certainly nothing to be ashamed about.     What are Head lice?   Head lice are small insects (their size can vary depending on the stage of their development, but adults are usually between 2-3 mm long when fully grown) which vary in colour from greyish white to brown. They like to set up home in a warm head of human hair and have no preference for the type of hair, be it brunette or blonde, straight or curly, head lice are not fussy. One preference they do show is contrary to common belief, they prefer clean hair to dirty hair.   There is only one way for head lice to pass from one individual to another and this is by head to head contact. Head lice cannot jump, hop or fly from one person to another, and it is also not possible for them to be passed on things like towels, combs and chair backs. A louse off the head will die very quickly.   Head lice spend most of their time on or near to the scalp as they need warmth to survive. They grip on to the hair by means of special claws and feed on the scalp by sucking up blood.   The female louse will lay up to 8 oval shaped eggs every night, gluing them to the base of individual hairs. After about seven days a young louse (nymph) emerges leaving behind it a white egg shell. These white egg shells remain glued to the hair and are known as nits. The nymph will begin feeding in the same way as the adult and within about ten days will be mature and capable of breeding     What to look for   Due to their size, colour and rapid movement head lice are very difficult to see. The eggs (creamy brown) are a little bit easier to spot and will be found attached to individual hairs near to the scalp. In contrast the white nits can often be seen further from the scalp, this is because as the hair grows the nits (which are still glued to the hair shaft) move with it. The best way to find head lice and their eggs is to run a tine-toothed comb (the detection comb found in each pack of Lyclear Creme Rinse is ideal) through damp parted hair looking carefully for evidence of lice. Signs to look for include faeces, cast skins, or dead lice Louse faeces appears in black flecks like dust, often this is rubbed onto collars, or the pillow at night resulting in shirts and bed clothes becoming dirty more quickly than usual.     How to prevent Head Lice   Steps that can be taken to reduce the possibility of an infection include:     Check children s hair on a regular basis for any signs of head lice. If evidence of an infection is found it is important to check the rest of the family and treat them if necessary.     Comb or brush hair frequently. Combing with an ordinary fine-toothed comb after washing the hair can assist prevention. as this may damage any lice present which will then die.     If a member of your family is found to have lice, please inform the local school, other parents, Health Visitor and School Nurse.          ",
"      Patient Information Leaflet   Please read this carefully before you start to take your tablets. This leaflet provides only a summary of the information available on your medicine. If you have any questions or are not sure about anything, ask your doctor or pharmacist.    What's in your tablets?   The name of your medicine is Ovranette.   Ovranette is supplied in a carton containing 3 blister packs of tablets.   Each blister pack of Ovranette contains 21 beige, shiny, sugar-coated tablets, each containing 150 micrograms of levonorgestrel and 30 micrograms of ethinyloestradiol. Ovranette tablets also contain lactose maize starch povidone, magnesium stearate, talc, sucrose, polyethylene glycol, calcium carbonate, glycerin, titanium dioxide, iron oxide yellow pigment (E172) and wax. Ovranette is an oral contraceptive.     The product licence is held by:   John Wyeth and Brother Limited trading as Wyeth Laboratories Huntercombe Lane South Taplow Maidenhead Berks SL6 0PH     The manufacturer is:    Wyeth Medical Ireland Little Connell Newbridge County Kildare Republic of Ireland      How the female reproductive system works   Once a month, an egg (or ovum) is released from one of the ovaries and passes along the fallopian tube to the womb. Fertilisation, (the joining together of the male's sperm with the female's egg) usually takes place while the egg is still in the fallopian tube. The fertilised egg embeds itself in the wall of the womb, which has been specially prepared to receive it, and it grows into a baby.     If fertilisation does not take place, then the egg b shed in the next menstrual period.     What do your tablets do?   Ovranette is a combined oral contraceptive, and belongs to a group of products often referred to as the Pill. Your doctor may also prescribe it for some other conditions, such as premenstnual tension, or heavy, painful or irregular bleeding. It contains different amounts of two types of hommone: an oestrogen (ethinyloestradiol) and a progestogen (levonorgestrel). These hormones stop the ovary from releasing an egg each month (ovulation). They also thicken the fluid (mucus) at the neck of the womb (cervix) making it more difficult for the sperm to reach the egg, and alter the lining of the womb to make it less likely to accept a fertilise egg.   Medical research and vast experience have shown that, if taken correctly, the Pill is an effective reversible form of contraception.     BEFORE YOU TAKE YOUR TABLETS Reasons for not taking Ovranette   You should   not take   these tablets:     If you think you may be pregnant     If you have now, or have ever had:     Clots in the blood vessels, high levels of blood fats (hyperlipidaemia) or other conditions which may make clotting in the blood vessels more likely     Cancer of the breast or cancer of the lining of the womb (endometrial cancer)     You should   not take   these tablets:      If you have     Abnormal red blood cells (sickle cell anaemia)     Serious long-term liver disease     Certain types of jaundice (Dubin-Johnson or Rotor syndrome)     Unexplained abnormal vaginal bleeding     If you have had any of the following whilst pregnant:     Itching of the whole body (pruritis of pregnancy)     Jaundice which was not caused by infections, poisons or obstruction to the flow of bile (idiopathic jaundice of pregnancy)     Worsening of inherited deafness (otosclerosis)     The rash known as pemphigoid gestationis (previously called herpes gestationis)       What you should know before you take the Pill   Women who take the Pill have an increased risk of developing a blood clot which can block a vein or artery (thrombosis) and can have severe effects. This risk is considered to be less with pills such as Ovranette which contain lower doses of contraceptive hormone. Women who smoke or who are overweight and those who have diabetes, varicose veins, migraine, heart disease or high blood pressure are at an increased risk of thrombosis. If you have any of these conditions, you should discuss the matter fully with your doctor.   The Pill is not recommended for older women who smoke because the risk of developing thrombosis is greater Fit women who are not overweight and who do not smoke may continue to use a modern low-dose Pill. It is important that you have regular check-ups, including having your blood pressure taken, to make sure you can continue to take the Pill. Cancer of the liver has rarely been reported in long term users of the Pill. Non malignant liver tumours have also been linked with Pill usage.   Information linking the use of the Pill and breast cancer remains unclear. Some studies suggest an increased risk of breast cancer in women who have taken the Pill for a long time. However, this risk is likely to be small,    You can take your pill at any time but you should take it about the same time each day. You may find it easiest to   second pack If you do not have a withdrawal bleed then, consult your doctor before starting the next pack. This advice can be summarised by following the diagram below:      If you have a stomach upset   If you have been sick or had diarrhoea, the Pill may not work. Continue to take it, but you may not be protected from the first day of vomiting or diarrhoea. Use another method such as a condom for any intercourse during the stomach upset and for the next seven days. In addition, if you have more than seven pills left in the pack, continue as normal. Then start your next pack as you would normally do after the usual gap between packs. But if you have fewer than seven pills left in the pack, start the next pack as soon as you have finished the present one, without having a gap between packs. Then continue as normal. This will mean you may not have a period until the end of two packs, but this will not harm you. Nor does it matter if you have some bleeding on pill-taking days.   If you do not have a period at the end of the second pack, see your doctor to make sure you are not pregnant.     Using Ovranette for something other than contraception   Your doctor may have prescribed Ovranette for some reason other than contraception and at a different daily dose. The doses which are usual for each different use of Ovranette are: Painful menstruation (dysmenorrhoea) or pre-menstrual tension - the same dosage is used as that described for oral contraception (1 tablet daily for 21 days then a 7 day break before starting the next pack).    Endometriosis - continuous treatment, taking 2 tablets every day.   Bleeding of the womb (uterus) - as for oral contraception (treatment for 21 days followed by a 7 day break) but taking 2 tablets per day (for the first month or two your doctor may ask you to take 4 or 5 tablets a day). If bleeding from your womb is more serious your doctor may ask you to take 4 tablets immediately and then 4-8 tablets daily until the bleeding is controlled.

"       PLEASE READ THIS LEAFLET CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU START YOUR TREATMENT.     IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR ARE NOT SURE ABOUT SOMETHING IN THIS LEAFLET, ASK YOUR DOCTOR OR PHARMACIST (CHEMIST)       CANESTEN 10% VC (VAGINAL CREAM)   WHAT IS CANESTEN 10% VC?   It is a white   vaginal   cream containing 10% of the active ingredient clotrimazole.   The other ingredients are benzyl alcohol, polysorbate, sorbitan monostearate, cetyl stearyl alcohol, isopropyl myristate, cetyl esters wax and water.   The single-dose 5g pack is a full course of treatment.   Canesten 10% VC contains clotrimazole.  This is one of a group of medicines called imidazoles which are used to treat fungal infections such as thrush.   Product Licence holder:   Bayer plc, Pharmaceutical Division, Bayer House, Strawberry Hill Newbury, Berkshire RG14 1JA Manufacturer: Bayer AG Leverkusen, Germany   WHEN SHOULD I USE CANESTEN 10% VC?   Canesten 10% VC should be used to treat vaginal thrush.    Vaginal thrush (candidiasis) is a common infection caused by a fungus which may live harmlessly in the vagina without you even noticing it.  However, in certain circumstances it may develop into an infection in the vagina and the symptoms may spread to the surrounding area (the vulva).   The common symptoms of thrush are:     itching of the vagina and vulva     redness and swelling of the tissues of the vagina and vulva     soreness of the vagina     a white non-smelling discharge from the vagina     Not everybody who has thrush has all these symptoms.  You may have only one of them.    If this is the first time you have had these symptoms, talk to your doctor before using any treatment.    WHEN SHOULD I NOT USE CANESTEN 10% VC?   Do not use Canesten 10% VC if you have previously had an allergic reaction to the active ingredient clotrimazole.  If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor.   See your doctor as soon as possible and   do not   use Canesten 10% VC if you have any of the following symptoms:     irregular vaginal bleeding     abnormal vaginal bleeding or a blood-stained discharge     ulcers, blisters or sores of the vagina or vulva     lower abdominal pain     pain or difficulty in passing urine     fever or chills     feeling sick or vomiting     diarrhoea     a foul smelling discharge from the vagina     This is because Canesten 10% VC may not be the right treatment for you.    If you are unsure whether you have thrush, check with your doctor before using Canesten 10% VC.    WHAT SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS SHOULD I TAKE?   If you are pregnant or are planning a family, tell your doctor or pharmacist before using Canesten  10% VC.  If you have informed your doctor or pharmacist already, follow their instructions carefully.   During pregnancy, extra care should be taken when using the applicator.   Before using Canesten 10% VC, you should see your doctor if:     you have had more than two infections in the last six months     you or your partner have ever had a sexually transmitted disease     you are aged under 16 or over 60 years     you have ever had an allergic reaction to Canesten or any other anti-fungal products     WHEN AND HOW DO I USE CANESTEN 10% VC?   The carton contains a pre-filled applicator of   vaginal   cream wrapped in foil.   You should insert the pre-filled applicator of vaginal cream into the vagina at night before going to sleep. Warning: do not exceed the stated dose.    Please follow the instructions below carefully         Remove the applicator from the foil packaging.   Insert the plunger ""A"" into the applicator ""B"" (Diagram 1).     Unscrew the red cap ""C"" (Diagram 2).    Carefully put the applicator as deeply as is comfortable into the vagina (this is easiest when lying on your back with your knees bent up) (Diagram 3).    Holding the applicator in place, slowly press the plunger until it stops so that the measured dose of cream is deposited into the   vagina   (Diagram 4). Remove the applicator.   Dispose of the applicator in a safe place, out of the reach of children.     You can help prevent further infections if you follow these simple self-help tips:     Try to avoid wearing tight nylon knickers and close fitting jeans too often.  These provide warm and airless conditions which help the thrush fungus to grow.     Wash daily, but use simple, unperfumed soaps – not heavily scented or medicated ones.  Do not scrub hard with sponges or flannels, and avoid hot baths with strong perfumed oils or disinfectants.  The most soothing bath to have if you have thrush is a warm one with some salt in it.     After going to the toilet, do get into the habit of wiping yourself from front to back, as a thrush infection may easily be transferred from the bowel.     If you are still worried or have any further questions about the symptoms or the treatment, do not hesitate to ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice.   Canesten 10% VC should be used in the   vagina   only.  Do not put it in your mouth or swallow it.  If you do accidentally swallow it, tell your doctor straight away or contact the Accident and Emergency Department of your nearest hospital.     WHAT SIDE-EFFECTS MAY I   EXPERIENCE?   The symptoms of thrush such as burning, soreness or itching of the vagina and surrounding area should disappear  within three days of treatment. If no improvement is seen after seven days, tell your doctor.   Rarely, Canesten 10% VC may cause side-effects In some people. The side-effects are very similar to the symptoms of thrush.  If the redness, burning, irritation or swelling get worse, stop using the pessaries and see your doctor as soon as possible.   As with all medicines, some people may be allergic to  Canesten 10% VC.  Usually, if you are allergic to the vaginal cream, a reaction will occur soon after you start using it.  An allergic reaction may appear as a rash, nausea,  faintness or facial swelling.  If you experience any of these effects, tell your doctor Immediately.   If you feel you are reacting badly to this medicine in any other way, speak to your doctor or pharmacist.   HOW SHOULD I STORE MY CANESTEN 10% VC?   Keep Canesten 10% VC in a cool place (below 25ºC) but not in the refrigerator.  It is best to keep Canesten 10% VC in the original carton.    Keep out of the reach of children   Do not use Canesten 10% VC after the expiry date which is printed on one end of the carton and  also on the applicator and its  foil wrapping.  Wherever you see ""EXP"" this means ""expiry date"".  For example, EXP 02/98  means that the cream must not be used after February 1998.   If you find that you still have this medicine after its expiry date, return it to your local pharmacist who will dispose of it properly.      Date of Preparation: January 1995    REMEMBER:   This medicine is for   your   use only.    Do not   give it to anyone else under any circumstances.  If you have any doubts about using Canesten 10% VC correctly, seek the advice of your doctor or pharmacist.   Product Licence Numbers: 0010/0136       ",

"     ABOUT YOUR NEBUHALER         Nebuhaler makes it easy for your inhaled medicine to be breathed down into the lungs where it is needed.   It contains a ONE–WAY VALVE.  This means that when you breathe IN through the mouthpiece, the valve opens up, and the medicine goes down into your lungs.   When you breathe OUT through the mouthpiece, the valve closes up.  None of the medicine will escape from Nebuhaler until you are ready to breathe in again.   So, whenever the inhaler canister is pressed down, the spray of medicine released will stay inside Nebuhaler until you are ready to breathe it in.    CLEANING INSTRUCTIONS   It is very important that Nebuhaler is cleaned regularly.   The clear plastic parts and the white canister holder should be washed once or twice each week in warm soapy water.   To make washing easier, Nebuhaler should be taken apart as follows:   Remove the canister from the white plastic holder before washing.   Pull out the white canister holder.   Press in, at the same time, the two round lugs near the middle of the Nebuhaler.   Twist the two halves, and pull them apart.   Lastly, pull off the mouthpiece.   After washing, allow all of the parts to dry out completely.  You may find that leaving them in a warm airing cupboard will speed this up.     HOW TO RE-ASSEMBLE NEBUHALER   Push the mouthpiece carefully back onto its seat.  Then ease the two halves back together, making sure that both of the round lugs hove clicked back into their holes.   Push the white canister holder back into place.   Finally replace the canister into the holder.    FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE CAREFULLY      INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING NEBUHALER           Shake Nebuhaler well to mix up the contents of the canister.     Place your lips around the mouthpiece.  Make sure that you don’t cover up the raised ring around the mouthpiece.. If you do, the small hole behind the ring will be obstructed.  Then breathe out gently, but not fully, THROUGH the mouthpiece.     Press the canister down once, to release a dose of medicine into Nebuhaler.  (It will stay there until you are ready to breathe it in.)  Then breathe IN slowly and deeply through the mouthpiece.     Wait for at least 5 seconds before breathing OUT through the mouthpiece.          REPEAT STEPS 1-5 IF YOUR DOCTOR HAS TOLD YOU TO TAKE MORE DOSES      Breathe IN again slowly and deeply through the mouthpiece, but DO NOT press the canister.  This will make sure that as much medicine as possible has been breathed in from Nebuhaler.    NOTE.  If you are very wheezy and cannot open the valve   when breathing in, tilt Nebuhaler upwards to open the valve.  Then breathe in with your head tilted slightly backwards.     NEBUHALER   Two different types of medicine can be used with Nebuhaler.  These are Bricanyl and Pulmicort, which are both available in canisters.  Your doctor may have prescribed one or both of these.   Make sure that you follow your doctor’s instructions carefully, and if you have been prescribed both types of canister take care not to get them mixed up.   Bricanyl acts by opening up the airways quickly to make breathing easier when you feel wheezy or tight chested.   Pulmicort is designed to help prevent the attack and must be used regularly at the dose and times recommended by your doctor.  It will not help once an attack has started so do not take extra doses.  However, you should still carry on using Pulmicort at the prescribed times.   CONTACT YOUR DOCTOR AS A MATTER OF URGENCY IF:   Your breathing is getting worse.    You are not getting relief from the current dose.    You frequently wake up at night with asthma.    You develop chest tightness in the morning, or it lasts for longer than usual.   Don’t wait until your canister runs out before you ask your doctor for a new one.    Nebuhaler should be replaced about every 6 months.    CAUTION – The aerosol canister is pressurised  – keep away from heat and direct sun.  Do not incinerate.  The valve should not be tampered with.     ",

The capsule body contains titanium dioxide (E171), iron oxide yellow (E172), iron oxide red (E172) and gelatin. The capsule cap ingredients are iron oxide black (E172) and those listed for the capsule body. Other ingredients which are added so that MINOCIN MR can be swallowed easily include cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, phthalate and light mineral oil.    WHO HOLDS THE LICENCE AND MAKES MINOCIN MR?    The licence for MINOCIN MR is held by Cyanamid of Great Britain Ltd, Fareham Road, Gosport, Hampshire, England. MINOCIN MR is manufactured by Lederle Laboratories in Pearl River, New York, USA and Fareham Road, Gosport, Hants.     WHAT CAN MINOCIN MR BE USED TO TREAT?   Minocycline, the active ingredient in MINOCIN MR, is a tetracycline antibiotic used in the treatment of acne. Acne results from clogging of skin pores. In its mildest form this causes whiteheads and blackheads. If these become infected, spots appear. MINOCIN MR reduces the infection and allows the spots to heal.    BEFORE TAKING THIS MEDICINE   If the answer to any of the following questions is ""yes"" you should talk to your doctor or pharmacist (chemist) before taking these capsules as they may not be suitable for you     have you had an allergic reaction to any tetracycline antibiotic in the past? (eg oxytetracycline, tetracycline, doxycycline or minocycline )     are you pregnant, breastfeeding or trying for a baby ?     do you have liver or kidney disease ?     are you taking any of the following: anticoagulants eg warfarin, penicillin antibiotics eg amoxycillin, indigestion remedies, or any preparations, such as vitamins, containing iron, calcium, aluminium, magnesium or zinc salts.     are you taking any other medicines or capsules including those that you have bought without a prescription ?     is the person that the medicine has been prescribed for under the age of 12?     MINOCIN MR may cause some people to become dizzy, lightheaded or unsteady. Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy or not alert.   If you take a contraceptive pill and get diarrhoea or sickness for ANY reason (for example, food poisoning, a 'bug' or as an unwanted effect of a medicine), or you lose blood when you don't expect to, your 'pill' may not work. You should either not have intercourse or use a barrier method of contraception to make sure you don't get pregnant (eg a condom or diaphragm/cap). Please read the leaflet that came with your 'pill', and talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure what to do or for how long to take these precautions.    HOW AND WHEN SHOULD I TAKE MINOCIN MR?      always take your capsules exactly as your doctor tells you to. This information should be on the pharmacist's label as a reminder.     the usual dose is one capsule every day.     MINOCIN MR should be taken at the same time(s) each day. If you have been told to take one capsule once a day (or daily) you should take one every 24 hours. For example you could take one at 9am each morning.     MINOCIN MR should be swallowed whole with a drink of water. The capsules should be taken while you are sitting or standing. They should not be sucked or chewed. It does not matter whether you take MINOCIN MR on an empty stomach or after food.     Never take more capsules than the doctor has told you to, it will not help you get better any faster and it could be harmful to you.     Acne responds quite slowly to antibiotics and it may be several weeks before you see any improvement in your acne and even longer before the full benefits are seen. For this reason it is important to finish taking all of the capsules prescribed for you by your doctor and to return to see him/her if you have been asked to do so.       WHAT TO DO IF YOU FORGET TO TAKE A CAPSULE   If you do miss a dose you should take it as soon as possible. This will help to keep a constant amount of medicine in the blood. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose.     WHAT TO DO IF YOU TAKE TOO MANY CAPSULES   If you have taken an overdose of MINOCIN MR, that is more capsules than the doctor has told you to take, you should get medical help immediately, either by calling your doctor or by going to the nearest hospital casualty department. Always take the labelled medicine container with you, whether there are any capsules left or not.     AFTER TAKING THIS MEDICINE   Like all medicines MINOCIN MR may cause unwanted effects in some people. Most of these are mild but if you experience any symptoms that worry you or are unusual contact your doctor or pharmacist (chemist) .   MINOCIN MR may cause some people to become dizzy or lightheaded, or have unsteadiness, an upset stomach, sickness, loss of appetite or diarrhoea.   Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy or not alert.   The following effects only occur in a very small number of patients:   Very rarely MINOCIN MR may cause skin problems. These include redness, itchiness, rashes, increased sensitivity of the skin to sunlight, scaling or blistering. Slight blue/black colour staining of the skin, teeth and the inside of the mouth have occurred very rarely and this staining usually disappears when the capsules are stopped. Skin staining may very rarely persist particularly if there is extensive scarring from acne.   Extremely rarely, MINOCIN MR can cause staining of the eyes, tears or sweat.   MINOCIN MR may cause an increase in pressure inside the head causing headaches. If you have a severe or persistent headache you should contact your doctor.   MINOCIN MR may cause swelling of certain parts of the body, for example, the liver, the pancreas or the outer lining of the heart. With this swelling a fever and 'butterfly' shape rash may rarely appear on the face. Should this rash and fever occur, contact your doctor.   MINOCIN MR may cause hypersensitivity reactions leading to itching, flushing, fever, rashes or difficulty in breathing. If you experience any of these symptoms or pain in your joints you should contact your doctor.   MINOCIN MR may cause problems with the blood such as anaemia.

"      Mintezol (thiabendazole, MSD)   PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS LEAFLET CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU START TO TAKE YOUR TABLETS.   Keep this leaflet. You may want to read it again.    What is in your tablets?    Active ingredient   The active ingredient in your tablets is thiabendazole. Mintezol is available as orange-coloured, chewable tablets marked 'MSD 907', containing 500 mg of thiabendazole BP.     Other ingredients   Acacia EP, calcium hydrogen phosphate EP, lactose EP, magnesium stearate EP, mannitol EP, methylcellulose EP, imitation orange flavour, imitation vanilla marshmallow flavour, sunset yellow E110.   Mintezol Tablets are available in blister packs of 6 tablets.      How do your tablets work?   The active ingredient in your tablets is thiabendazole. This belongs to a group of medicines known as anthelmintics, and it is effective against certain worms which are parasites in humans. Thiabendazole kills the adult or larval form or the eggs of different worms.     Who makes your tablets?   Your tablets are made by Merck Manufacturing Division, Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited, Shotton Lane, Cramlington, Northumberland, for Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited, Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, UK, who hold the Product Licence in the UK and the Product Authorisation in Ireland.     Why do you need to take these tablets?   Your doctor has probably prescribed Mintezol for you because you have certain types of worms living in your body. These worms usually live in your gut but may be found elsewhere in your body. Mintezol may be given on its own or with other medication.     Are there patients who should not take these tablets?   Yes, do not take the tablets if:     you are or think you may be pregnant.     you are breast-feeding.     you have had a bad reaction to this or similar medicines, or to any of the ingredients in the past.     Experience of using Mintezol in children weighing less than 15 kg (33 lb) is limited.   If you think any of these apply to you do not take the tablets, go and talk to your doctor first and follow his advice.     What else should you know before taking your tablets?   You should tell your doctor if you have or have had any disorder of the liver, kidneys or nervous system. Your doctor will probably want to take blood and/or urine samples during treatment to monitor your liver and/or kidneys.   You should tell your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant. If you are anaemic, dehydrated or malnourished, your doctor will probably treat these conditions before you start taking Mintezol.   You should not take Mintezol to prevent you from getting worms.     What about driving and operating machinery?   Since Mintezol may reduce alertness in some patients, you should avoid hazardous activities like driving, or operating machinery.   If you are unsure or confused, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.     Can you take Mintezol with other medicines?   There are a few other medicines which may interfere with Mintezol. Your doctor knows about these and will alter your treatment as needed. It is important that you tell your doctor about all the medicines you  are taking, including those obtained without a doctor's prescription.   You must tell your doctor if you are taking any medicines which contain xanthine derivatives such as theophylline (for example, for asthma, bronchitis emphysema or certain heart conditions).     How should you take Mintezol?   You must take your tablets exactly as advised by your doctor. You should take the tablets with meals and chew them before swallowing. You do not need to follow a special diet, and cleansing enemas are not necessary.   The usual recommended schedule is 2 doses every day. The size of the dose depends on your bodyweight. Each dose for patients weighing less than 60 kg (132 lb) is 25 mg thiabendazole per kilogramme of patient's weight. Each dose for patients weighing 60 kg or more is 1.5 9 thiabendazole, with a maximum daily dose of 3 9 (6 tablets). The table below will show you the number of tablets per dose, according to your weight.    Patients weightDose (twice daily)   kglbNo. of tablets 1022½ 20441 30661½ 40882 501102½ 60 (or more)132 (or more)3    Your doctor will have told you for how long to take Mintezol. This is usually one to seven days, depending on the type of worm infection. A repeat course may be given if necessary. It is important that you follow your doctor's instructions carefully.   Some patients may have side effects on 2 doses a day. If that is the case, your doctor may prescribe a single dose of 25 mg per kg of bodyweight after the main meal on the first day, then the same dose again 24 hours later after a similar meal.     What if you forget to take a tablet or take too many?   If you miss a dose take the next one with the next meal. Do not take an extra one to make up.   If you take too many tablets by mistake seek medical attention immediately.     What unwanted effects could your tablets have?   Like all medicines, Mintezol may occasionally cause side effects in some patients. The most common side effects are loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting and dizziness. Other less frequent side effects are diarrhoea, abdominal pain, itching, headache, weariness, giddiness, numbness, and drowsiness. Rare side effects which have occurred are blood disorders of which the symptoms may be fever and/or sore throat, ringing or other noises in the ears, visual disturbances including blurred or reduced vision, yellow vision, dry or red eye, irritability, increased blood sugar which may cause thirst, sweating, or passing large volumes of urine, urinary incontinence and bed wetting, blood in the urine, faintness, collapse, liver disorders (causing yellowing of eyes and skin),anal rash, convulsions, dry mouth and eyes, confusional states, mood swings, nightmares.

If you notice any of the above effects or you have any other unusual symptoms or feelings, stop taking Mintezol and contact your doctor immediately.     How should your tablets be kept?

"    KONSYL RANGE KONSYL - Sugar Free/KONSYL - Orange/KONSYL - Dex    PATIENT INFORMATION LEAFLET   Fiber performs several useful functions that enhance good health.  It adds bulk. Thus, fiber is an excellent bowel normalizer.  Additionally, fiber helps in the treatment of haemorrhoids and Irritable Bowel Syndrome.    What is Fiber?   It is important to know that there are two major categories of dietary fiber:   soluble and insoluble.   Soluble fiber   absorbs water, adds bulk in the stomach, and works throughout the digestive system.  Recent studies have demonstrated that soluble fiber may lower blood cholesterol, thus reducing the risk of heart disease.  Research also suggests that soluble fiber slows the absorption of sugars from the small intestine, which is important for diabetics.   By contrast, insoluble fiber absorbs little water and adds bulk only in the lower intestine, rather than in the entire digestive tract.   When a doctor recommends a fiber supplement, it will likely be Ispaghula, a rich source of soluble fiber.      DIRECTIONS  FOR USE:    MIX THIS PRODUCT (CHILD OR ADULT DOSE) WITH AT LEAST 8 oz.      (APPROXIMATELY 250ml) OF WATER.  TAKING THIS   PRODUCT WITHOUT ENOUGH LIQUID MAY CAUSE CHOKING.            Put one sachet into an empty glass. Add 8 oz (approximately 250ml) of cool water.

"      Norplant Levonorgestrel    Before you start   Please read this leaflet carefully before you decide about using Norplant. It provides you with a summary of the information available on Norplant. If you have any questions or are not sure about anything please ask your doctor or clinic.     What is Norplant?   Norplant consists of six small, thin capsules each containing 38 mg of levonorgestrel, a hormone used in many contraceptive pills. The capsules are made of medical grade elastomer (Silastic Type 372 and medical adhesive Type A).   The capsules are placed just under the skin by a trained doctor or nurses where they slowly release the hormone over a period of up to five years or until the capsules are removed.   Norplant is an effective, long-term and reversible method of contraception.   Product licence holder: Roussel Laboratories Ltd Denham, Uxbridge, UB9 5HP.   Manufacturer: Leiras Oy, Turku, Finland.     How does Norplant prevent pregnancy?   Norplant acts as a contraceptive by thickening the cervical mucus so that sperm cannot get through to any eggs and also by preventing the regular release of eggs. When Norplant is removed you will return to your usual level of fertility.     Before using Norplant   Norplant is a long-term, hormonal method of contraception that can be used by most women. However, some women should not use Norplant. You must tell your doctor if:     you are pregnant or suspect that you are pregnant.     you have or have had a stroke, heart-attack, high     blood pressure or very high lipid/cholesterol levels. - you have liver trouble.     you have undiagnosed vaginal bleeding. - you are allergic to levonorgestrel.     you have had breast cancer.     you have had an unusual outcome to a recent pregnancy, (eg trophoblastic disease).       Warning   Some women will have to be especially careful when using Norplant. You should tell your doctor if:     any member of your family has had a stroke, heart attack, high blood pressure or very high lipid/cholesterol levels.     you suffer from or have suffered from migraine.     you are overweight.     you are breastfeeding.     you suffer from or have suffered from depression.     You may still be able to use Norplant, even if you have had some of these conditions. Your doctor or clinic will advise you.   The doctor or nurse who inserts or removes Norplant for you should have completed the required training programme. If your own doctor has not been trained, they should be able to refer you to one who has been.     Are you taking any other medicines?   It is important to tell your doctor about all the medicines you are taking, including any you have bought without a prescription.   Some medicines used to treat epilepsy, tuberculosis or fungal infections, for example, may interfere with the action of Norplant. Your doctor will be able to alter your treatment if this is necessary. If appropriate, you may be advised to use additional contraception for a short time.     What is involved?   The six capsules have to be inserted in your upper arm by a trained doctor or nurse. This will be on your left arm if you are right-handed and on your right arm  if you are left-handed. As this will need a small cut to be made into the skin, a local anaesthetic will be used. Some discolouration, bruising and swelling may be present for a few days, but these should not interfere with your normal activities. Do not bump the site. Keep it dry and covered with a small bandage for three days.     How quickly does Norplant work?   It depends on when your Norplant is inserted. If you are having periods as usual and you are not taking any other type of hormonal contraception like the Pill, Norplant should be inserted preferably on the first day of bleeding of your next period. You will then be protected from pregnancy immediately.   If this is not convenient, insertion can take place up to 5 days after the start of your period. However, if Norplant is inserted later than day one of your period an additional non-hormonal (barrier) method of contraception (e.g. condoms) must be used for 7 days after insertion. Ask your doctor to explain this to you.     Follow-up   Your doctor may want to check the site of your Norplant after a short period of time. You will need regular check-ups while on Norplant. Your doctor or clinic will advise you how frequently your visits should be.     Can I have Norplant after a miscarriage or abortion?   After abortion Norplant may be inserted immediately but if this is not done within 5 days, an additional non-hormonal (barrier) method of contraceptive (e.g. condoms) should be used for 7 days after insertion. There are no specific instructions for insertion in women following miscarriage.     What about Norplant after having a baby?   Norplant can be used after childbirth and it makes no difference whether you are breast feeding or not. Norplant can be inserted on the 21st day after your baby is born. This will provide contraceptive cover straight away. If you leave it later than day 21 you should use an additional non-hormonal (barrier) method of contraception for seven days.     Can I change my mind?   Norplant can be removed at any time during the five years. Contact your doctor or clinic and they will arrange it for you. However, as Norplant lies under the skin, please do not attempt under any circumstances to remove it yourself.   Norplant can be removed at any stage of the menstrual cycle. If you do not want to become pregnant and you are not having another Norplant inserted you   must use another form of contraception straight away  .     How is Norplant taken out?   Norplant is removed by making a small cut in the skin at more or less the same place as they were put in. Again a local anaesthetic will be used.   Removal of your Norplant capsules will take slightly longer than it took to insert them, usually 20-30 minutes. Occasionally (in about 5% of cases), one or more of the capsules may be difficult to remove. If it is not possible to remove all six capsules at once, you may be asked to return to the doctor to remove the remaining capsules after the area has healed, about 4-6 weeks later.     After five years   If you want to carry on using Norplant, ask your doctor or clinic to make an appointment for you about a month before the final date for removal. When the first set of capsules are removed, a new set can then be inserted. It is important not to go over the five years without using some form of contraception because your usual level of fertility may return very quickly after this time.     What if I want a baby?   Your usual level of fertility will return very quickly after Norplant is removed. However, it will help if you wait until you have had one normal period before you    With this type of hormonal contraception there is a     ",

"    Occlusal salicylic acid BP 26% in a polyacrylic vehicle    Occlusal   is a topical solution for the treatment of common warts and verrucae.  It contains salicylic acid HP (26%) a keratolytic agent (which helps to soften and remove wart tissue), in a special polyacrylic vehicle, which is applied direct to the wart, and which after drying, needs no bandages or plasters.    Indications and Usage:   The treatment and removal of common and plantar warts.    Dosage and Administration:   Before applying Occlusal, soak the wart in warm water for five minutes.  Remove any loosened tissue with a brush, pumice stone or emery board and dry the area with a towel not used by others, to avoid passing the infection on, as warts are contagious.  Apply Occlusal carefully to the wart twice, using the applicator brush provided, avoiding contact with the surrounding healthy skin.  Allow the first application to dry completely before applying the second.  Treatment should be repeated daily and continued for as long as your doctor advises.  Improvement may be seen in one to two weeks, but complete removal may take between six and twelve weeks, depending on the size and location of the wart.  If the wart is not successfully treated in twelve weeks, go back to your doctor.  The dosage is the same for children, adults and the elderly.    Contraindications:   Occlusal should not be used by diabetics or patients with impaired blood circulation.  Do not use on moles, birthmarks, unusual warts with hair growth, on facial warts, or on the anal or perineal region.    Precautions:   Occlusal is for external use only.  Do not permit contact with eyes or mucous membranes.  If contact occurs flush Immediately with water for 15 minutes.  Do not allow contact with normal skin around wart.  Avoid using on areas of broken or damaged skin.  Discontinue treatment if excessive irritation occurs.  A localised irritation may occur if Occlusal is accidentally brought into contact with healthy skin surrounding the wart.  This can normally be controlled by stopping application for a few days and being more careful in applying the solution when treatment is resumed.  Continuous use of Occlusal during pregnancy and lactation particularly if large areas of skin are involved, should be avoided.  Salicylic acid preparations can cause a condition known as salicylism if large doses are used over a long period.  The most frequent symptom of salicylism is ringing in the ears and if this is experienced you should stop treatment and contact your doctor.    OCCLUSAL IS FLAMMABLE - KEEP AWAY FROM FIRE OR FLAME.     KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN.    Keep the bottle tightly closed when not in use and avoid dripping the solution onto the thread of the bottle-neck, which can make opening difficult.    Excipients:   The polyacrylic vehicle contains polyvinyl butyral B76 (HSE), dibutyl phthalate (HSE), isopropyl alcohol (USP), butyl acetate (HSE), acrylates co-polymer B66 (HSE).    Supply and Storage:   Occlusal is supplied in 10ml amber glass bottles complete with a brush applicator in the cap, and should be kept at room temperature.  Do not use after the expiry date shown on the bottle and carton P/L No. 10670/0006 PA 564/4/2   Leaflet prepared June 1993     EURODERMA LIMITED    THE OLD COACH HOUSE, 34 ELM ROAD CHESSINGTON, SURREY KT9 1AWCHESSINGTON, SURREY KT9   OCC.PIL-936    See over for instructions for use.

"    Patient Information Leaflet      injection for migraine   What you should know about Imigran injection   Please read this carefully before starting to use your medicine.    What your injection does   Imigran injection contains sumatriptan, the first of a new group of medicines developed for the treatment of migraine and a rare condition called cluster headache.   The symptoms of migraine may be due to swollen blood vessels around the brain. Medicines like Imigran probably work by reducing the size of these blood vessels and are called 5HT1 agonists.    IF YOU ARE NOT SURE WHY THIS HAS BEEN PRESCRIBED FOR YOU ASK YOUR DOCTOR      Before using your injection      Have you been told you are allergic to Imigran or sumatriptan?     Do you suffer from unexpected shortness of breath or from pain or tightness in the chest (which may o; may not spread to your jaw or upper arms)? If so please inform your doctor of these symptoms before using your injection     Have you been told you have any of the following medical conditions:     heart disease such as - heart failure angina coronary thrombosis (heart attack) high blood pressure disease of the liver or kidneys?     Are you taking any medicines for your migraine which contain ergotamine? (If so, you should stop taking them at least 24 hours before using Imigran injection).     Are you taking any medicines on a doctor's prescription for the treatment of depression or to help you lose weight?     Are you pregnant, or likely to become pregnant or breast feeding? (See also back of this leaflet)     Are you over 65 years of age?     Do you have a family history of heart disease?       IF THE ANSWER TO ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS IS YES     Did you tell your doctor at the last visit or an earlier visit?      IF YOU DID NOT TELL YOUR DOCTOR THEN YOU   SHOULD DO SO AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND BEFORE USING YOUR INJECTIONS   You should also talk to your doctor before using these injections if you have been told you have sugar diabetes, or a high blood cholesterol or if you are a regular cigarette smoker or if you are very overweight.    Your doctor will advise you about using the medicine    Look at the label      It should say WHO should use it, WHAT DOSE and   WHEN If it does not or you are not sure, ask your doctor or pharmacist or follow this advice:   Carefully read the notes with the Imigran SUBJECT injection system on how to use it. Only use the SUBJECT Pen in this way. The Imigran SUBJECT injection system will inject a dose of Imigran just below the skin quickly and without pain. The injection must   NOT   be given in any other way than with the SUBJECT Pen.   Use one injection as soon as you feel a migraine coming on If your migraine does not go,   DO NOT   use a second one for the same attack.   If your migraine goes, then comes back, you can repeat the injection provided it is at least an hour since the first injection    DO NOT   use more than two injections in 24 hours.   Because there is little experience of its use in children or those over 65 years of age it is not usually prescribed for these age groups    After starting to use your injection   Within an hour or two of having an injection most people find their migraine is much better If the injection does not ease your migraine, you may then take your usual 'pain killers,' provided they do not contain ergotamine. Wait at least six hours after one injection before taking any medicines containing ergotamine.   Most people find using this medicine causes no problems. As with most medicines, a few people may find they have side-effects to it See the back of this leaflet for more information     Where to keep the injections   You may wish to carry the Imigran SUBJECT carry case and injections with you in case of a migraine attack.   Keep your injections away from heat and out of the light which could spoil them.   Always keep your injections in the case provided and at a temperature below 30°C/86°F If they are kept warmer than this for more than 24 hours it could spoil them As with all medicines, keep them safely away from children. A child may be harmed by medicine prescribed for someone else   Read the notes with the Imigran SUBJECT injection system on what to do with the cartridges containing the used syringes and needles Take care to follow this advice.    YOU WILL FIND OUT MORE ABOUT YOUR INJECTION ON THE BACK OF THIS LEAFLET   More information on IMIGRAN INJECTION     What your injection contains   Each pre-filled cartridge syringe contains:      The active ingredient -sumatriptan 6mg (as the succinate) in 0.5ml of sterile sodium chloride solution    Side-effects   Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause unwanted effects. Most people using this medicine find it causes no problems.   Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side-effects occur:    Rare   Sudden wheeziness, fluttering or tightness in the chest Swelling of eyelids, face or lips Skin rash - red spots or hives (skin lumps)   If you notice any of these side-effects it may be that you are allergic to the medicine.   Do   not   use any more injections unless your doctor tells you to do so.   A few people may notice the following side-effects:       Uncommon   Feelings of tingling, warmth, heaviness, pressure, tightness or sometimes pain in different parts of the body, including the chest and throat; although sometimes very strong they usually pass off in a few minutes. If they continue or are particularly severe (especially chest pain) tell your doctor immediately. Do   NOT   use any more injections; your doctor will decide if you should stop using them.   Also;   Tiredness or sleepiness (  IMPORTANT   if you are driving or working a machine) Dizziness Flushing (redness of face lasting a few minutes) Feelings of weakness Feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting)-when not part of migraine attack   These are not usually very troublesome and pass off with time. There is no need to stop treatment unless you find them too unpleasant.   Sometimes the injections may sting but this soon goes away.   If you feel unwell or have any other unusual discomfort you don't understand, it is important to tell your doctor as soon as possible.      What to do if too many injections are given   It is important to keep to the dose on the label. Using more than this could make you ill. If an overdose is given,   DO NOT DELAY  , ask your doctor what to do or contact your nearest hospital emergency department.      Pregnancy and breast feeding      As with most medicines it is better not to use Imigran injection if you are pregnant, especially during the first few months of the pregnancy Your doctor will advise you.   The sumatriptan in Imigran injection may pass into mothers' milk. It is better, therefore, that breast feeding mothers do   NOT   use this injection.    If you do not feel better   If you do not get satisfactory relief of your migraine by using Imigran injection then tell your doctor at your next visit.     What to do with any unused injections   If your doctor stops your treatment do not keep any left-over injections unless your doctor tells you to. Return any injections to your pharmacist for safe disposal.   Do not use Imigran injection after the expiry date printed on the pack but return it to your pharmacist.     Remember   These injections are for YOU. Only a doctor can prescribe them for you. Never let someone else use them. There may be reasons why they could harm that person.

"      Betaferon   Important information, please read carefully.    Betaferon contains the following substances (Composition)    Active ingredients:   1 ml of the prepared solution for injection contains 0.25 mg (8 million IU) of Interferon beta-1b. Betaferon is formulated to contain 0.3 mg (9.6 million IU} of Interferon beta-1b per vial at a calculated overfill of 20%. inactive ingredients: Human albumin, dextrose      What presentations of Betaferon are available?   Each pack of Betaferon contains 15 vials of Interferon beta-1b and 15 vials of 0.54% sodium chloride solution.     How does Betaferon work?     (Properties of the preparation)   Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system (CNS) (i.e. brain and spinal cord) and its exact cause is unknown. An abnormal response by the body’s immune system is thought to play an important part in the process which damages the CNS.   Interferon beta-1b has been shown to modify the immune system response.   Interferons belong to the family of cytokines, which are naturally occurring proteins.     Who is responsible for Betaferon?     (Name and address of the holder of the marketing authorisation, manufacturer)   Schering AG, D-13342 Berlin.     For what purpose is Betaferon used?     (Indications)   Betaferon is indicated for use in ambulatory patients (patients who can walk) with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) characterized by at least two attacks of neurologic dysfunction over a two year period followed by complete or incomplete recovery. In this patient population Betaferon was shown to reduce the frequency and severity of clinical relapses, to reduce the number of MS related hospitalizations and to prolong the relapse-free time.   There is no evidence of an effect of Betaferon on the length of attacks, symptoms in between attacks, or the progression of the disease. The effect of Betaferon on performance of daily activities or in the social field is not known. Betaferon has not yet been investigated in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis.   There is no evidence of an effect on disability.   Clinical studies show that not all patients respond to treatment with Betaferon. Despite treatment worsening of the symptoms during attacks has been observed in some patients. It is not possible to foresee which patients will not respond or whose symptoms will worsen despite treatment.     When should Betaferon not be used?     (Contraindications)   You should not use Betaferon if you are pregnant or if you have a history of hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or human albumin.   You should not use Betaferon if you are under 18 years of age, because it has not been investigated in this age group. It has not been investigated in this age group. You should also not use Betaferon if you have a history of severe depressive illness and/or suicidal thoughts, liver failure or inadequately treated epilepsy.   If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, treatment with Betaferon should be discontinued.     What precautions must be observed during the use of Betaferon?   Depression and suicidal thoughts have been reported by patients. In rare cases this may lead to suicidal  attempts. If you experience such symptoms, contact your doctor promptly.   If you have a history of seizures or of depression or if you suffer from pre-existing heart disorders, Betaferon should be administered with caution. Caution should also be exercised if you are taking anti-epileptic drugs. Betaferon should also be administered with caution if you have a bone marrow disorder. If your white blood cell count decreases, your doctor should monitor you closely for the development of fever or infection.   It is not known if Betaferon has a negative effect on human fertility but based on the experience with other interferons a decrease in male or female fertility cannot be ruled out. There is no information on the use of Betaferon in patients with kidney problems. Therefore, if you have such problems, your kidney function should be monitored during treatment. During the treatment with Betaferon your body may produce substances which may reduce the effectiveness of the treatment. This is called neutralising activity and only occurs in some patients. However, it is not possible to foresee whether you belong to this group of patients with reduced efficacy or not.     May Betaferon be used during pregnancy and lactation?   Betaferon should not be used during pregnancy or if you are trying to become pregnant. If you wish to become pregnant, discuss the matter with your doctor first. While using Betaferon women of childbearing age should take appropriate contraceptive measures. If you do become pregnant you should stop your treatment and contact your doctor immediately.   It is not known whether Interferon beta-1b is excreted in human milk. However, since serious adverse reactions to Interferon beta-lb in breast-fed infants are theoretically possible, you should discuss the mater with your doctor and make a decision whether breast-feeding or Betaferon should be stopped .     What to be aware of if you are taking any other medicine (Interactions)   With the exception of corticoids or ACTH, Betaferon should not be used with substances modifying the immune system response.   Caution should be exercised when Interferon beta-1b is administered in combination with other drugs which need a certain liver enzyme system (known as cytochrome P450 system) for their metabolism. These drugs include some widely used antipyretics (drugs against fever and pain), oral contraceptives, and antiepileptics.     How is Betaferon used?     (Dosage and administration)   The treatment with Betaferon should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the disease.   At the present time it is not known how long treatment with Betaferon should last. Effectiveness of this therapy for more than two years has not been established.   The duration of treatment will be decided by your doctor. Treatment is not recommended if you have had fewer than two MS attacks in the previous two years.   Before administration, the Betaferon solution for injection has to be prepared from a vial of Betaferon and 1.2 ml of liquid from a vial of diluent. 1.0 ml of the prepared Betaferon solution for injection is then injected subcutaneously (under the skin) every other day. This is equal to 0.25 mg (8 million IU).   This will either be done by your doctor or his/her assistant or by yourself after you have been carefully and sufficiently instructed and trained. To assist you in subcutaneous self-administration of Betaferon, detailed instructions for self-injection are provided with this leaflet. These instructions also tell you how the Betaferon solution for injection is prepared.       What to do if you miss an injection   If you forget to administer your injection at the correct time you should give it as soon as you remember. Your next injection should be given 48 hours later.     What effect could an overdose of Betaferon have? (Overdosage)   Administration of many times the dose of Betaferon recommended for the treatment of MS did not lead to life-threatening situations. However, in the case of accidental overdosage, please consult the doctor who has prescribed Betaferon for you. Also if by mistake you administer your injection too frequently (e.g. one injection every 24 h instead of one injection every 48 h) you should consult your doctor.    Are there any side effects during the use of Betaferon?   Injection site reactions including inflammation, pain hypersensitivity, skin cell-death (necrosis), and non-specific reactions occur frequently. The occurrence of injection site reactions usually decreases over time. Flu-like symptoms (fever, chills, muscular pain, a general feeling of being unwell, or sweating) have been seen frequently. The occurrence of the symptoms decreased over time.   Menstrual disorders may occur in premenopausal women.   Central nervous system (CNS) related adverse events including depression, anxiety, emotional instability, loss of identity or reality (depersonalization), convulsions, suicide attempts, and confusion have been observed.   Serious hypersensitivity reactions are rare. If a severe reaction occurs, consult your doctor immediately. The number of white blood cells can decrease and the activity of enzymes which are closely related to the function of the liver may increase. Therefore, a differential white blood count and determination of serum chemistry (SGOT, SGPT) should be obtained prior to treatment and repeated regularly during the therapy. If side effects are severe or if you notice any other side effects please inform your doctor.     How should Betaferon be stored?   Betaferon must be kept cold (2-8°C). Store it in a refrigerator (but not in a freezer or the freezing compartment) before reconstitution (preparing the Betaferon solution for injection). If, after reconstitution, you do not inject Betaferon at once, you can store the reconstituted solution in a refrigerator (but not in a freezer or the freezing compartment) up to 3 hours.   Please note the expiry date on the pack. Do not use after this date.   Store all drugs properly and keep them out of the reach of children.     Package insert was last updated on:   July 12, 1995.     Annex:     SELF-INJECTION PROCEDURE   The following instructions are intended to explain how to prepare Betaferon for administration and how to proceed in injecting Betaferon yourself. Please read the instructions carefully and follow them step by step. Your doctor or his/her assistant will instruct and assist you in learning the procedure and the technique of self-administration. Do not attempt self-administration until you are sure that you understand the requirements for preparing the injection solution and giving the injection to yourself.   The instructions comprise the following main steps:     Preparing for self-injection.     Drawing up the diluent (sodium chloride solution) into the syringe     Injecting the required volume of diluent (1.2 ml) into the vial of Betaferon.     Drawing up the required volume of the solution for injection (1.0 ml) into the syringe.     Choosing and preparing the injection site and injecting the Betaferon solution (1.0 ml) subcutaneously (under the skin).       Preparing for self-injection       Collect   all your equipment before you begin the process.     You will need:     vial of diluent for Betaferon(sodium chloride solution 0.54%)     vial of Betaferon     2-ml syringe     21-gauge needle     27-gauge needle     alcohol wipes     disposal unit (a container for used syringes and needles)        Wash   your hands thoroughly with soap and water.      Remove   the protective caps from both vials.     Use alcohol wipes to   clean   the tops of the vials move in one direction and use one wipe per vial.     NOTE:   Leave   an alcohol wipe on top of each vial until you are ready to use it.    Drawing up the diluent (sodium chloride solution) into the syringe   Only the vial of diluent (liquid) that comes inside your prescription package should be used to dissolve the white powder in the Betaferon vial.     Resting your hands on a stable surface,   remove   the syringe from its wrapping. Do not touch the tip (nozzle) of the syringe.     Take the 21-gauge needle out of its wrapping and place it firmly   onto   the tip (nozzle) of the syringe.   Remove   the needle guard from the needle. Do not touch the needle.      Pull back   the plunger (on the syringe) to the 1.2 ml mark.     NOTE: Read the label on the vials - find the diluent vial and throw away the alcohol wipe on top of it.     Holding the vial of diluent on a stable surface, slowly insert the needle straight through the rubber stopper, into the top of the vial.     NOTE: When inserting and removing needles from vials, be sure not to touch the needles or the rubber stoppers on the vials with your hands.   If you touch a stopper, clean it with a fresh alcohol b wipe. If you touch a needle or the tip (nozzle) of the  syringe, throw it away into the disposal unit and start with a new one.   If the needle touches any surface, throw it away into the disposal unit and start with a new one.      Push   in the plunger all the way to gently inject air into the vial (  leave   the needle in the vial of diluent).     Turn the vial of diluent   upside down  .     NOTE: Keep the needle tip in the liquid.     Resting your hands on a stable surface, hold the vial and syringe in one hand and slowly   pull back   the plunger of the syringe to the 1.2 ml mark (to draw up that amount of liquid) with your other hand. Keeping the vial upside down, gently   tap   the syringe until any air bubbles rise to the top of the barrel of the syringe.     Carefully   push   in the plunger to eject ONLY THE AIR through the needle. Make sure that the syringe contains 1.2 ml of diluent.      Remove   the needle with the syringe from the vial of diluent.      Injecting the required volume of diluent (1.2 ml) into the vial of Betaferon   NOTE: Find the Betaferon vial and throw away the alcohol wipe on top of it.     Holding the Betaferon vial on a stable surface, slowly   insert   the needle of the syringe (containing 1.2 ml of liquid) all the way through the stopper of the vial.     Push the plunger down slowly,   directing   the needle toward the side of the vial to allow the liquid to run down the inside wall (injecting diluent directly onto the powder will cause excess foaming).     Make sure that the needle   does not come into contact   with the powder or the resulting solution.

"      Indocid PDA Injection (indomethacin, MSD)   PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS LEAFLET CAREFULLY IF YOUR BABY HAS BEEN GIVEN OR WILL BE GIVEN INDOCID PDA INJECTION.   Keep this leaflet. You may want to read it again.    What is in this injection?    Active ingredient   The active ingredient in Indocid PDA injection is indomethacin sodium USP. Each vial contains indomethacin sodium equivalent to 1.0 mg indomethacin as a sterile powder for reconstitution with sterile water.     Other ingredients   There are no other ingredients.   Indocid PDA injection is available in cartons of three 1 ml vials.      How does this medicine work?   While a baby is inside its mother's womb it does not need to use its lungs. An unborn baby has a blood vessel called a ductus arteriosus near the heart which allows the baby's blood to bypass the lungs and circulate to the rest of the body.   When the baby is born and starts using its lungs the ductus arteriosus normally closes up. However, in some cases this does not happen. The medical term for this condition is 'patent ductus arteriosus', i.e. an unclosed ductus arteriosus. If the ductus arteriosus is not closed it can cause heart problems in your baby. Indocid PDA, when given to your baby, can help to close the ductus arteriosus.   It is not known exactly how indomethacin works, but it is believed that it closes a ductus arteriosus by inhibiting the production of prostaglandin, a naturally occurring chemical in the body which keeps the ductus arteriosus open.     Who makes this medicine?   Indocid PDA is made by Merck Manufacturing Division, Merck & Co., Inc., West Point, Pennsylvania, USA, for Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited, Hertford Road Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, who hold the Product Licence in the UK and Product Authorisation in Eire.     Why does your baby need this medicine?   Your doctor has prescribed Indocid PDA for your baby because your baby has a ductus arteriosus which has not closed properly. Indocid PDA should close this vessel.     Are there patients who should not be given this medicine?   Indocid PDA should not be given to babies if:     they have an infection which has not been treated.     they are bleeding, especially if the bleeding is inside the skull or in the intestines.     they have other problems with their heart which require the ductus arteriosus to remain open so that adequate circulation of the blood is maintained.     they have problems with their blood clotting.     they have certain problems with their intestines.     they have kidney problems.     Your baby's doctor will be aware of these, but if you are worried or confused, talk to the doctor treating your baby.     What else should you know about Indocid PDA?   There are other things regarding Indocid PDA which you should know about and these are given below.   If your baby has an existing infection which is being treated, the doctor should treat your baby with indocid PDA only after careful consideration of your baby's condition.    Treatment with Indocid PDA should be stopped if your baby is suspected of having liver disease, signs and symptoms of which include yellowing of the skin and eyes.   Indomethacin may reduce the ability of your baby's blood to clot. Your baby should therefore be watched for signs of prolonged bleeding.   Indocid PDA should be carefully administered to your baby by the healthcare professional, to avoid damage to the skin and surrounding tissues.   Your baby may develop some bleeding from the intestines. To detect this, your baby's stools may be tested to determine if there is any blood present in them.   Premature babies may start bleeding inside the brain. As indomethacin may reduce the ability of your baby's blood to clot, the potential for your baby to start bleeding inside the brain may increase.   Indocid PDA may reduce the amount of urine your baby passes. If this is significant, your baby's treatment may be stopped until the volume of urine passed by your baby returns to normal. Serious kidney problems, including renal failure, may occur in some babies who receive Indocid PDA, however this is most likely to occur in babies who are already sick with other problems.   Your baby may develop low levels of sodium (a naturally occurring chemical in your baby's body) in the blood; therefore, your baby's kidney function and blood should be monitored.   If you are worried or confused by any of the above, you should talk to the doctor treating your baby.     Can Indocid PDA be given with other medicines?   There are certain medicines which, if given together with Indocid PDA, may cause unwanted effects. These are detailed below.   Your baby may have problems passing urine and may have been prescribed frusemide. Indocid PDA can reduce the effect of this drug.   Your baby may be given gentamicin or amikacin to treat an infection. Indocid PDA may increase the levels of these antibiotics in your baby's blood.   Your baby may have been given digitalis to help a heart disorder. Indocid PDA can prolong the effect of this drug. Your baby should therefore be frequently checked by an ECG (electrocardiogram), which is a technique used to monitor the heart, and the level of digitalis in the blood should be measured.   Your baby's doctor will be aware of the effect g Indocid PDA can have with these drugs, but if you are worried or confused, you should talk to the doctor treating your baby.     How should Indocid PDA be given?   Babies with patent ductus arteriosus are often cared for in a special neonatal intensive care unit where your baby's condition can be closely monitored. Your baby will have been given or is about to be given Indocid PDA injection by a healthcare professional, who will know how to prepare the injection prior to administration.   Indocid PDA is usually given as a course of three injections, each injection being given at 12- to 24-hour intervals. The amount of Indocid PDA given depends close(y on the age and weight of your baby.   If your baby's ductus arteriosus is closed or significantly reduced in size 48 hours after the first course of therapy (i.e. 3 injections), no further treatment is necessary. If your baby's ductus arteriosus reopens, a second course of therapy may be given.     What if your baby misses a dose or has too much Indocid PDA?   Indocid PDA should be administered only in a neonatal intensive-care unit. The dosage given is based on your baby's age and weight. Your baby will be closely monitored to prevent or detect the possibility of overdosage. If you have any concerns about your baby's dosage of Indocid PDA or if you think your baby may have missed a dose, you should talk to the healthcare professional treating your baby.    In addition, Indocid PDA can cause abnormally low blood levels of naturally occurring chemicals called sodium and glucose, and abnormally high levels in the blood of naturally occurring chemicals called potassium and urea. These are only detectable by special blood tests, and the doctor treating your baby     ",

Genital herpes is caused by a virus which is closely related to the virus that causes cold sores.   The virus is most often spread from person to person during sexual contact. This could be through oral, vaginal or anal sex with someone who has an outbreak of genital herpes at the time.     What is genital herpes like?   The first attack of genital herpes usually has the worst symptoms. Further outbreaks, if any, are shorter and less painful. The symptoms you may experience are as follows:     You may feel unwell with flu-like symptoms such as a temperature, headache or backache. You may also have pains down the thighs and legs or in the groin.     Small blisters can develop around your genitals. In women they may be hidden inside the vagina or on the cervix (neck of the womb). These burst and leave small painful sores like mouth ulcers. They usually heal in a week or two. If not treated, new blisters can form or they can take longer to heal.     Passing urine may be painful for both men and women if the urine comes into contact with the sores.     Blisters, burning and pain in the genital or anal area.       How is genital herpes treated?   Anti-viral tablets help to stop the virus spreading and causing more blisters. They help you get better quicker. It is important to take them as early as possible, as soon as you know that an attack is starting.     What else can you do during an attack?   There are several things which you can do yourself to soothe the infected area and help you feel better:     Some people find gently washing their genitals In a warm, salt water solution (one teaspoon to half a pint of water) can ease the pain. Do this for five to 10 minutes, two to four times a day     Avoid hot baths, but try cool showers. They may soothe the sore area     For women who experience pain when urinating, try passing urine while in the bath or shower This will dilute the urine and ease the pain     Keep the area around your infection cool and dry by wearing loose underwear.     You may take painkillers and also use  painkilling creams or gels. These can help to ease the pain of broken blisters, but should only be taken on the advice of your doctor or pharmacist.     During an outbreak there are some other things you should not do:     Do not scratch or touch the sore area You may spread the virus on your fingers. Always wash your hands.     Avoid sunbathing and do not use sunbeds, as these can make the sores more painful.     Call your doctor if you need to pass urine and cannot do it. Tell your doctor if you have a rash all over, or feel generally ill.     How to prevent further outbreaks   Not everybody who gets an outbreak of genital herpes will have another one If you do they are usually milder and fewer as time goes on. They may stop altogether.   The virus usually stays quiet for much of the time. but it can flare up and cause another outbreak There are several things which could cause this. but there are also things that you can do to try and prevent from happening.     Feeling run down or stressed and for women around the time of your period -   get more rest  .     Friction from sexual activity -   try using a lubricant (water-based like KY Jelly).      As mentioned in the last section, sunbathing and sunbeds should be avoided if you find they bring on an outbreak.    Protecting your partner from infection   During an outbreak of genital herpes, the blisters and sores are very contagious. The virus can be passed on to your passed by direct contact, at these times and for several days afterwards      Do not:   have any genital or anal contact. Using a condom is not enough to protect your partner from the virus.      Do not:   have oral sex when you or your partner have mouth or genital sores.      Do not:   forget to wash your hands with soap and water after touching the sore area      Do not:   share towels or flannels.

What is Eprex for?   Eprex is used to treat the anaemia associated with kidney disease. If you have kidney disease, your kidney may not produce enough erythropoietin (necessary for red cell production) and your doctor may wish to correct this by prescribing Eprex. This medicine stimulates your bone marrow to produce more red blood cells, helping to treat your anaemia.   Eprex can also be used to treat anaemia in patients who are receiving platinum-chemotherapy.   Doctors can also prescribe Eprex to mildly anaemic patients who are going to have surgery and prior to it, donate blood so that their own blood can be given to them during or after surgery. Because Eprex stimulates the production of red blood cells, a higher volume of blood can be taken from these patients.   Your doctor may prescribe this medicine for other reasons. You should discuss this with him/her.     Is Eprex safe for you?   Do not use this medicine if you have high blood pressure which is not properly controlled with blood pressure-lowering drugs.

Are you taking other medicines?   Eprex does not normally react with other medicines but please tell your doctor if you are using, or have recently used anything else to treat your present symptoms.   If you are taking a drug called cyclosporin to suppress your immune system after a kidney transplant, your doctor may order special blood tests to measure cyclosporin levels while you are taking Eprex.   Iron supplements and other blood stimulants may increase the effectiveness of Eprex. Your doctor will decide if it is right for you to take them.   Eprex should be given alone. It should not be mixed with other liquids for injection.

Remember to tell your doctor that you are receiving Eprex if you have to visit the hospital or family doctor for any treatment, or to visit the clinic for a blood test; Eprex may affect the results.     How should Eprex be used?   Your doctor will conduct investigations, for example blood tests, to help decide if it is necessary for you to have Eprex. He/she will work out the right dose of Eprex for you to use and for how long the treatment should last. These decisions will be influenced by whether you are receiving dialysis or not and if you are receiving dialysis, whether this is through a vein (haemodialysis) or your abdomen (peritoneal dialysis) .   Only one dose of Eprex should be taken from each injection vial. Any fluid which remains should be thrown away.

The usual starting dose of Eprex is 50 International Units (IU) per kilogram. This is given three times a week by injection into a vein (over 1-2 minutes) or under the skin. Depending on how your anaemia responds to treatment, the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is controlled. Your doctor may order regular blood tests to see that this is being achieved. The dose you receive should not normally exceed 200 IU per kilogram, three times a week.   When your condition has been brought under control, you will receive regular doses of Eprex, two or three times a week. These doses may not be as high as those you received initially.   Eprex should be given after you have received a dialysis session.     If you are receiving peritoneal dialysis:   The dose you receive is based on your body weight in kilograms. The usual starting dose is 50 IU per kilogram. This is given twice a week, injected under the skin. Depending on how your anaemia responds, the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is controlled. Your doctor may order regular blood tests to see that this is being achieved. The total weekly dose that you receive should not normally exceed 200 IU per kilogram.     Use in ADULTS not receiving dialysis     If you are not receiving dialysis:   The dose you receive is based on your body weight in kilograms. The usual starting dose is 50 IU per   kilogram. This is given three times a week by injection usually under the skin but sometimes into a vein.   The starting dose may be adjusted by your doctor until your condition is controlled. Your doctor may order regular blood tests to see that control is being achieved. After your condition has been brought under control, you will receive regular doses of Eprex, three times a week.

Use in CHILDREN receiving haemodialysis   The dose for children is based on body weight in kilograms. The usual starting dose is 50 IU per kilogram. This is given three times a week, injected into a vein (over 1-2 minutes). Depending on how the anaemia responds, the dose may be adjusted approximately ever 4 weeks until the condition is controlled. Your doctor will order regular blood tests to see that this is being achieved.   Eprex should be given after the child has received a dialysis session.     Changing from injecting into a vein to injecting under the skin   Once your condition is controlled you will receive regular doses of Eprex. Your doctor may decide that it is better for you to receive Eprex by injection under the skin (subcutaneous) rather than into a vein (intravenous).The dose should remain the same while the change is being made. Afterwards, your doctor may order blood tests to see if any adjustment in dose is required.     Injecting Eprex under the skin yourself   At the start of your therapy, Eprex may be injected by medical or nursing staff. However, your doctor may decide that it is right for you to learn how to inject Eprex under the skin (subcutaneously) yourself. You will receive appropriate training for you to do this. Under no circumstances should you attempt to inject yourself unless you have been trained to do so.     What to do if you take too much Eprex   Eprex has a wide safety margin and side effects due to an overdose of taking Eprex are unlikely. You should inform the doctor or nurse immediately if you think too much Eprex has been injected.     What side effects can Eprex cause?   As with any other medicine, Eprex may cause unwanted side effects.If you experience headaches, particularly sudden, stabbing migraine-like headaches or start to feel confused or have fits, tell your doctor or nursing staff immediately. These may be the warning signs of a sudden rise in blood pressure which requires urgent treatment.   Other side effects may include:     raised blood pressure which may require treatment with drugs or adjustment of the dosage of drugs you already take for high blood pressure. Your doctor will monitor your blood pressure regularly while you are taking Eprex.     flu-like symptoms, such as headache, aches and pains in the joints, feeling of weakness, tiredness dizziness and chills. These may be more common at the start of treatment. If you experience these symptoms during the injection of Eprex into a vein, slower injection may help to avoid them.     fits (seizures), skin rashes and accumulation of fluid under the skin of the eyelids (oedema), which may result from an allergic reaction.     an increase in levels of small cells (called platelets) in your blood may occur, particularly when starting treatment. Your doctor will check on this.      Kidney disease patients:     a raised level of potassium in the blood (hyperkalaemia). Your doctor will be able to detect this from a blood test. If it is found, he may decide to stop treatment with Eprex until it is controlled.     Blood clot formation (thrombosis) in your shunt. This is more likely if you have low blood pressure or if your fistula has complications. If this is the case your doctor may recommend aspirin.     clotting of blood in the haemodialysis system. There may be a need to increase your heparin dose during dialysis.      Tell your doctor or nursing staff immediately if you experience any of the above effects or notice anything else unusual while you are receiving treatment with Eprex.       How should Eprex be stored?   In hospital vials and pre-filled syringes are stored unopened in a refrigerator between 2 and 8 degrees centigrade. Vials and pre-filled syringes should be protected from light.   If you are using Eprex at home, it is important that this too is stored in your refrigerator although not in the freezer compartment. Eprex should not be frozen. Leave Eprex vial or syringe to stand for a few minutes until it reaches room temperature prior to using it.     Other important points   Eprex should not be used:     after the expiry date on the label     if the seal is broken     if the liquid is coloured or you can see particles floating in it     if you know, or think that it may have been accidentally frozen     Always keep medicine out of the reach of children.

"      Neogest   This leaflet tells you about oral contraceptives in general and about Neogest in detail. Please read it carefully to get the best from Neogest. if you are in any doubt about these instructions contact your doctor, pharmacist or Family Planning clinic.    You and the pill How your body gets ready for pregnancy (the menstrual cycle)   You can usually become pregnant (conceive) from when you start to have periods, up until you are in your late 40s. Every menstrual cycle takes about 28 days. About halfway through this cycle an egg is released from one of your ovaries into a fallopian tube. This is called ovulation.   The egg travels down the fallopian tube towards your womb. When you make love, your partner's penis releases millions of sperm into your vagina. Some of these sperm travel up through your womb into your fallopian tubes. If there is an egg in one of these tubes, and a sperm reaches it, you can become pregnant. This is called 'conception'.   A fertilised egg gets embedded in the lining of your womb and takes 9 months to grow into a baby. As an egg can live for up to 2 days, and sperm for up to 5 days you can become pregnant if you have made love up to 5 days before ovulation and for some time afterwards. If a sperm does not fertilise an egg, the egg is lost at the end of the menstrual cycle with the lining of your womb. This is called a 'period'.     How do natural hormones work?   Your menstrual cycle is controlled by two sex hormones made by your ovaries: one called oestrogen, the other progesterone (a progestogen). Oestrogen increases during the first half of your menstrual cycle and makes your womb develop a thick lining, ready to receive the egg if conception happens. Progesterone comes later in the cycle and changes the lining of the womb still further to prepare it for pregnancy.   If you do not become pregnant, you make less of these hormones and this causes the lining of your womb to break down and the lining leaves your body as a period. But during pregnancy, your ovaries, and then the placenta (this attaches the growing baby to the womb and gives it food), carry on making progesterone and oestrogen to stop any more eggs being released.     How does the pill work?   There are two types of pill, the combined pill and the progestogen-only pill. A combined pill contains two hormones which are like those your body produces (oestrogen and progestogen).   Neogest is a   progestogen-only pill   which contains only progestogen and no oestrogen.   Neogest works by thickening the fluid (mucus) in the neck of your womb (cervix) which makes it more difficult for sperm to enter the womb. It also changes the lining of your womb so that it does not thicken enough for an egg to grow in it. In some women it also stops the ovary releasing an egg each month (ovulation).     How effective is Neogest?   Progestogen-only pills, such as Neogest, are not quite as effective as combined oral contraceptives. However, Neogest provides a very high degree of protection against pregnancy.   To make Neogest as effective as it can be you must take it regularly, and at the same time each day. You must follow your doctor's instructions and take the tablets exactly as it says in this leaflet.     Product information The name of your medicine is: Neogest (norgestrel)       What does Neogest contain?   Each pack of Neogest contains 35 dark brown, sugar-coated tablets. Each tablet contains 75 micrograms of norgestrel. Norgestrel is one of a group of substances called progestogens, which is similar to a hormone progesterone, that is produced naturally by women.   Neogest also contains the following inactive ingredients: lactose, maize starch, povidone, polyethylene glycol 6000, calcium carbonate (E170), talc, magnesium stearate (E572), sucrose, montan glycol wax, titanium dioxide (E171), glycerin (E422), brown ferric oxide (E172).   Each pack of Neogest contains a memo strip of 35 tablets.   Neogest is a progestogen-only contraceptive pill. Progestogen-only contraceptives contain one female type of hormone, a progestogen.

Uses   Neogest is an oral contraceptive. When used as instructed you are very unlikely to become pregnant.     Reasons for not taking Neogest   Before taking Neogest, tell your doctor if you have any of these:     you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant.     blood clots in the legs, lungs, eyes, or anywhere else or have ever had these. If you have had a heart attack or if you have any medical condition which makes you more at risk of developing blood clots.     abnormal red blood cells (sickle-cell anaemia).     cancer of the breast (mammary carcinoma) or have ever had this condition.     abnormal bleeding from your vagina of unknown cause.     certain types of jaundice (Dubin-Johnson or Rotor syndromes).     severe diabetes with changes to the blood vessels.     liver tumours or have ever had these.     any other long or short-term liver disease.     allergy to any of the ingredients of Neogest.     Do not take Neogest if you have had any of these conditions when you were pregnant:     itching of your whole body (pruritus of pregnancy).     the rash known as herpes gestationis.     yellowing of the skin ( jaundice).       What you should know before taking Neogest   Before you start taking Neogest your pelvic organs breasts and blood pressure should be checked by your doctor and these checks should be repeated regularly. The doctor will also make sure you are not pregnant.   Diabetes (diabetes mellitus) or a tendency towards diabetes needs watching carefully while you are taking the pill.   If you have had an ectopic pregnancy (where the foetus develops somewhere other than the womb), or one of your fallopian tubes is missing, you should discuss this with your doctor before using Neogest.   If you have an irregular menstrual pattern together with stomach pains whilst taking Neogest, you should see your doctor.     Taking other medicines with Neogest   Some medicines may stop Neogest from working properly. If you are taking any other medicine while you are taking Neogest, be sure to tell your doctor (or dentist). Your doctor (or dentist) can tell you whether you should use extra contraceptive precautions and for how long.   Medicines which can sometimes stop Neogest from working properly are antibiotics (such as ampicillin and rifampicin); griseofulvin (which is used to treat fungal infections); phenylbutazone (which is used as an anti-inflammatory drug to treat some types of joint   diseases); phenytoin, primidone, phenobarbitone and some other medicines used in people with epilepsy, and carbamazepine (which can be used to treat epilepsy or other illnesses).   If you are taking any of these medicines you might still be able to use Neogest, but you will also need to use an extra contraceptive method (condoms or cap plus spermicide} while you are taking the other medicine and for 14 days after you stop taking it. If you are taking griseofulvin, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, primidone, phenobarbitone, carbamazepine or other drugs to treat epilepsy for a long time you may not be able to use Neogest. Check with your doctor, pharmacist, or Family Planning clinic.   If you are taking rifampicin you will need to use another method of contraception as well as Neogest. You should do this while you are taking the rifampicin and for 4 weeks after you stop.   If you are diabetic your doctor may alter the dose of medicine required to treat your diabetes.   If you are in doubt check with your doctor, pharmacist or Family Planning clinic.     Stomach upsets   Being sick or having very bad diarrhoea may stop Neogest from working properly and make it less effective. Carry on taking Neogest as usual, and also use another method of contraception (condom or cap plus spermicide) until 14 days after you have recovered from the stomach upset. If your stomach upset continues for some time, consult your doctor who may consider another form of contraception.   If you are sick (vomit) very soon after taking your pill, you can take another pill within 3 hours of the normal time and you will then have contraceptive protection (as long as you are not sick again). You can use the last pill in the pack for this purpose. If you have repeated vomiting use an extra method of contraception as described above.     Warnings   It has been suggested, on the basis of statistical evidence, that the risk of developing various disorders of the circulation of the blood is slightly greater in women who take the pill than in those who do not. This can lead to, for example, deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in the leg), strokes (blood clots and haemorrhages from the blood vessels of the brain), heart attacks or pulmonary embolism (blood clots blocking the arteries of the lungs). People do not always fully recover from these disorders, and, very rarely, they are fatal. However, such associations are less clear with progestogen-only pills.   Certain conditions increase the risk of thrombosis. They include:     smoking.     obesity.     some diseases of the heart and blood vessels.     diabetes.     migraine.     a major operation or period of immobilisation (e.g. you are in bed after an accident or operation or you have a plaster cast on a broken leg).     if any members of your family have suffered from thromboembolic diseases (e.g. deep vein thrombosis, stroke or heart attack) at a young age.     varicose veins.     If any of these conditions apply to you before you decide to take Neogest or while you are taking Neogest you must discuss them with your doctor.   The risk of arterial thrombosis (e.g. heart attack and stroke) associated with the pill increases with age, and this risk is increased by cigarette smoking.   Signs and symptoms of blood clots are given in the section ""Reasons for stopping Neogest immediately"".   On rare occasions, the use of the pill has led to liver diseases such as jaundice and benign liver tumours, and, very rarely, it has been associated with some forms of malignant liver tumours (cancer) in long-term users. Liver tumours may lead to life-threatening intra-abdominal haemorrhage (bleeding in the abdomen). Therefore, if you have pain in the upper  abdomen that does not soon clear up, tell your doctor.   Also, if your skin becomes yellow (jaundice) you must tell your doctor.    If you think you might be pregnant, stop taking   Neogest and consult your doctor immediately. Use another method of contraception such as a condom until you see your doctor.   Certain conditions may sometimes get worse during use of the pill. The diseases are those listed under 'What you should know before taking Neogest"".      Reasons for topping Neogest immediately   If you experience any of the following conditions, take no further tablets of Neogest and consult your doctor immediately. In the meantime use another method of contraception such as a condom.     migraine for the first time, or if existing migraine occurs more often than before.     unusually bad headaches or if you have headaches more often than before.     sudden changes to your eyesight, hearing, speech, sense of smell, taste or touch.     Unusual pains in your leg or unusual swelling of your arms or legs, sharp pains in your chest or sudden shortness of breath, crushing pains or feelings of heaviness in your chest, coughing for no apparent reason, dizziness or fainting, or if one side of your body suddenly becomes very weak or numb. These may be symptoms of blood clot formation or symptoms of an inflammation of veins combined with the formation of blood clots (thrombophlebitis).     your skin becomes yellow (jaundice), you develop hepatitis (inflammation of the liver) or if your whole body starts itching.     a large increase in your blood pressure.     definite worsening of conditions which had got worse during a previous pregnancy or while taking the pill in the past.     pregnancy.     Surgery or immobilisation. You must stop Neogest six weeks before a planned major operation (e.g. stomach surgery), if you are having any surgery to the legs, or medical treatment for varicose veins. Also if you are immobilised for a long time (e.g. you are in bed after an accident or operation or you have a plaster cast on a broken leg). Your doctor will advise you when to start taking Neogest again.      How to take Neogest   This pack is designed to help you remember to take your pills.    When to start   If you are new to the pill or are starting the pill again after a break, take your first Neogest tablet on the first day of bleeding of your next period. For other users, follow instructions for ""Changing from another type of oral contraceptive"", ""Starting Neogest after having a baby"" or ""Starting Neogest after a miscarriage or an abortion"".   Start with a pill marked with the correct day of the week, for instance, if your period starts on a Wednesday, start with a pill marked ""Wed"".      Taking your first pack of Neogest   After taking your first pill, take one pill each day, following the direction of the arrows, until the pack is empty.   You should try to take the pill at the same time every day, for example, after breakfast, so that the interval between tablets is always 24 hours.   Swallow each pill whole, with water if necessary.    Make sure that you are never more than three hours late with a pill otherwise the contraceptive protection may be lost.     You should use another method of contraception,   such as a condom, for the first 14 days of tablet taking. This is for the first pack only.      Taking your next pack of Neogest When you have finished the first pack, start a new pack the very next day, again taking a pill marked with   that day of the week. For example, if you finish your pack on a Tuesday start the next pack on Wednesday with a pill marked ""Wed"". Do not leave a gap between packs.    You will be taking pills through your periods and there must be no break between packs.     Changing from another type of oral contraceptive   If you are starting Neogest immediately after any other oral contraceptive, finish that pack and then start taking Neogest the next day. Do not leave a gap between packs. Start with a pill marked with the correct day of the week. Then follow the instructions under ""Taking your first pack of Neogest"".   You should use another method of contraception, such as a condom, for the first 14 days of tablet taking. This is for the first pack only.     Starting Neogest after having a baby   If you have just had a baby, your doctor may advise you to start taking Neogest 7 days after delivery, provided you are fully mobile. You do not have to wait for a period.   You will need to use another method of contraception, such as a condom, until you start Neogest and for the first 14 days of pill taking  . Follow the instructions as before (see ""Taking your first pack of Neogest"").   Neogest has not been shown to reduce the amount of milk you produce. There is no evidence to suggest that the small amounts of the hormone that appear in the milk are harmful to a healthy baby. However, if your baby has severe or long-standing jaundice that requires medical treatment you should not breastfeed your baby after being given Neogest.      Starting Neogest after a miscarriage or an abortion   If you have just had a miscarriage or an abortion your doctor may advise you to start using Neogest immediately.   You should use another method of contraception, such as a condom, for the first 14 days of tablet taking  . This is for the first pack only. Follow the instructions as before (see ""Taking your first pack of Neogest"").     While you are taking Neogest     What if your periods seem different?   Your periods may be irregular you may have some bleeding between periods, or you may have no periods at all. This is normal when taking Neogest, especially during the first few months. These changes generally require no treatment. It however, the bleeding is heavy and lasts a long time, you should discuss this with your doctor.     What to do if you miss a period   Occasionally, you may miss a period. While this can mean you are pregnant, it is most unlikely if you have taken your pills correctly. However, you should see your doctor if you have had no bleeding for 6 weeks.     If your doctor asks you to keep a record of your bleeding   Each pack of Neogest contains a calendar. Your doctor may ask you to fill this in. Your doctor will then be able to check your pattern of bleeding.    When you start taking Neogest, fill in the name of the month and put an 'S' (start) in the appropriate date square. As this first day of pill-taking will be on the first day of a period, put an 'X' for this day and all the other days of your period. If you forget to take one or more pills, mark these days with an 'O'.     What to do if you forget to take a pill   If you forget to take a pill please follow these instructions:    If you are more than 3 hours late in taking a pill, or have missed one or more pills   contraceptive protection may be lower, so you must use extra protection. You must continue taking your pills at your normal time and use an extra contraceptive method (e.g. condoms) for the next 14 days.     If one pill is 3 hours late or less   Don't worry. Contraceptive protection should not be affected if you take the late pill at once, and keep taking your next pills at the usual time.     What if you want to have a baby?   Your doctor relies on the date of your last true period before you get pregnant to tell you when your baby will be born. So, if you stop taking Neogest to have a baby, use another method of contraception until you have had a natural period. However, it will not be harmful if you become pregnant straight away.     Overdosage   If overdosage does occur, no serious ill-effects are expected. Contact your doctor or pharmacist if you are at all worried.     Possible side-effects   Sometimes mild unwanted effects can occur in the first few months after starting Neogest:     bleeding and spotting between your periods.     no periods.     headaches or migraine.     feeling sick, being sick and stomach upsets.     depressive moods, loss of interest in sex.     dizziness     allergic reactions.     changes in weight.     If you think that you have any unwanted effect due to Neogest, even if it has not been mentioned, or you have a serious reaction as described earlier in this leaflet, tell your doctor or pharmacist.     Effects on blood tests   The use of oral contraceptives may affect the results of certain laboratory tests. Always tell your doctor or the laboratory staff that you are using an oral contraceptive.    Expiry date:   The expiry date is printed on the pack. Do not use after this date.

A.The effect of the injection will vary from patient to patient and further injections may be given when symptoms return and not at regular intervals.

"    Guidance on how much ointment to use    If your doctor has told you in detail how to use the ointment then keep to that advice otherwise:–   Twice a day, after washing your hands, gently rub the correct amount of ointment into the skin until it has all disappeared.    For an adult:     You should find that two fingertips of ointment will treat both hands or one foot three fingertips of ointment will treat one arm six fingertips of ointment will treat one leg fourteen fingertips of ointment will treat the front and back of one trunk        Fingertip Units         Do not worry if you find you need a little more or a little less than this - it is only a rough guide.   Wash your hands before using the ointment. Gently rub the correct amount into the skin until it has all disappeared.   Unless   used for treating the hands wash them again   after   using the ointment. Anyone who helps to rub in the ointment should also do the same or wear disposable plastic gloves.      For a child   It should not be used in children under one year of age.   The smaller the child the less you use.   A child of 4 years needs about a third of the adult amount.   A course of treatment for a child should not normally last more than five days unless your doctor has told you to use it for longer.      Has the ointment any side effects?      Most people find using this ointment causes no problems when used in the right amount for the correct length of time (See above).   Occasionally some people experience a little burning or irritation when the ointment is applied.   IF you find your condition gets worse during treatment you may be allergic to the ointment or have a skin infection.    STOP USING THE OINTMENT AND TELL YOUR DOCTOR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE   Using more than the correct amount may:   -thin the skin so it damages easily -allow the active ingredient to pass through the skin and affect other pans of the body especially in infants and children, and during pregnancy.   However, this is very unlikely unless treating very large areas and using large quantities of Cutivate.   If your doctor has prescribed the ointment for psoriasis you should let your doctor review your progress at regular intervals, as such treatment needs careful supervision.   Repeated courses of topical steroids over a long time may sometimes cause changes in hair growth and skin colour.   If you feel unwell or have any unusual discomfort you do not understand, tell your doctor as soon as possible.    Where to keep your medicine   As with all medicines keep this ointment safely away from children.   Store it at room temperature below 30°C.     What to do with any unused ointment   If your doctor stops your treatment, return any unused ointment to a pharmacist. Only keep it if your doctor tells you to.   Do not use the ointment after the expiry date on the tube or carton.     Remember   This ointment was prescribed for YOU so never give it to someone else to try - even if they seem to have the same problem. There may be reasons why it could harm that person.

"    Patient Information Leaflet    Trimovate Cream    Trade mark      What you should know about Trimovate Cream    What your cream does   Trimovate Cream is a mild but effective treatment for inflamed skin conditions such as eczema, napkin rash and dermatitis. in which infection may be a problem.      IT IS IMPORTANT TO READ THIS CAREFULLY BEFORE STARTING TREATMENT   Following this advice gives the cream a chance to work safely and effectively.    What is in your cream   Trimovate Cream is one of a group of medicines called topical steroids. ""Topical"" means they are put on the skin. Topical steroids reduce the redness and itchiness of certain skin problems (They should not be confused with ""anabolic"" steroids misused by some body builders and taken as tablets or injections).   Trimovate Cream also contains antibiotic agents which may help to prevent or clear up infections of the skin.   Ingredients of the cream include:   The main active ingredient - clobetasone butyrate 0 05% an antibacterial agent - oxytetracycline an anticandidal agent - nystatin a preservative - chlorocresol an antioxidant - sodium metabisulphite (E223) a colouring agent - titanium dioxide (E171) in a base containing glyceryl monostearate, cetostearyl alcohol, polyoxyl 40 stearate, dimethicone 20, glycerol and white soft paraffin   The cream does not contain any lanolin or parabens.     Before you use your cream   This cream has been prescribed to treat the skin problem that you showed to your doctor.   DO NOT put it on any other skin problems as it could make them worse, especially:   acne some skin infections such as cold sores, herpes, impetigo, athletes foot, chicken pox, ringworm, thrush     If you have had an allergy to any creams or ointments in the past      If you think you may be pregnant     Did you tell your doctor at the last visit or an earlier visit?   IF YOU DID   NOT   TELL YOUR DOCTOR THEN YOU SHOULD DO SO   BEFORE   STARTING THE TREATMENT   Even so, your doctor may still want you to use the cream.    Face –   YOU SHOULD NOT normally use on the face for many weeks or months as this skin may thin more easily. If your doctor has told you to use it on the face then keep it out of the eyes.     Children –   DO NOT use under the napkin, or airtight dressing of an infant for more than a week. (These make it easier for the active ingredient to pass through the skin).      How to use your cream   If your doctor has told you in detail HOW MUCH to use and HOW OFTEN then keep to this advice.   If you are not sure then follow the advice on the back of this leaflet.      Unless told by your doctor:     YOU SHOULD NOT use more than this.     YOU SHOULD NOT use on large areas of the body for a long time (such as nearly every day for many weeks or months). Although Trimovate Cream is generally regarded as safe even when used like this for many months it may be possible to produce side effects if   overused  . Such overuse may thin the skin so that it damages easily and some of the active ingredient may pass through the skin and affect other parts of the body, especially in infants and children.     If your skin problem does not improve in seven days tell your doctor.  continued    NOTE - The cream can stain hair, skin or fabric. To avoid this a cotton bandage or clean cloth can be put over the treated area.   Stain can usually be removed from clothes that can be washed, by using a hot wash (60ºC) with a biological washing powder.      Has the cream any side effects?      Most people find using this cream causes no problems when used in the right amount for the correct length of time (See above as well as guidance on back of this leaflet).   IF you find your condition gets worse during treatment you may be allergic to the cream or have a skin infection which needs other treatment.    STOP USING THE CREAM AND TELL YOUR DOCTOR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE   Repeated courses of topical steroids over a long period of time may sometimes cause changes in hair growth and skin colour.    Guidance on how much cream to use If your doctor has told you in detail how to use the cream then keep to that advice otherwise:-   Up to four times a day, after washing your hands, gently rub the correct amount of cream into the skin until it has all disappeared.    For an adult:   You should find that two fingertips of cream will treat both hands or one foot three fingertips of cream will treat one arm six fingertips of cream will treat one leg fourteen fingertips of cream will treat the front and back of one trunk    Fingertip Units               Do not worry if you find you need a little more or a little less than this - it is only a rough guide.   Wash your hands before using the cream. Gently rub the correct amount into the skin until it has all disappeared.   Unless   used for treating the hands wash them again   after   using the cream. Anyone who helps to rub in the cream should also do the same or wear disposable plastic gloves.   The bacteria that cause infections like the warm, moist conditions under a bandage or dressing so always clean the skin before a fresh dressing is put on.      For a child:   The smaller the child the less you use.   A child of 6 months to 1 year needs about a quarter of the adult amount and a child of 4 years about one third.        ",

It also contains citric acid, sodium chloride, sodium citrate, onium chloride and water. It is a nasal spray; one bottle contains 84 spray doses ( 1 week's treatment).   Buserelin is one of a class of medicines called LHRH analogues. It works by decreasing the production of sex hormones.

Before taking your medicine   Tell your doctor if you have diabetes or high blood pressure of if you have ever suffered from depression.   Tell your doctor if you are taking any other medicines.   Tell your doctor of any problems you have had with this or other medicines in the past.     How should I use Suprefact?   Follow your doctor's advice about when and how to use your medicine and look at the label and leaflet. Your pharmacist may also help if you are not sure.   The usual dose needed to reduce hormone production is two sprays (one into each nostril) six times a day. This is best taken as one spray into each nostril before and after breakfast, one spray into each nostril before and after the midday meal and one spray into each nostril before and after the evening meal.   To keep hormone levels lowered, it is very important to take all your Suprefact doses regularly every day.   You can continue to use Suprefact if you have a cold.

If you miss a dose of Suprefact, take another as soon as you remember unless it is nearly time for your next dose. Never double-up on the next dose to make up for the one you missed.   If you take too much Suprefact tell your doctor.     What undesirable effects may Suprefact cause?   Any medicine can have side-effects.   You may notice symptoms such as hot flushes, sweating or enlargement of the breasts or you may have a decreased interest in sex. These symptoms may not appear until several weeks after starting treatment. If they are severe tell your doctor.   At the beginning of the treatment the amount of sex hormones may be increased and you may notice a   temporary worsening in symptoms. Usually you will be given another medicine to prevent this.   Some people find that the nasal spray irritates the nose and may even cause nosebleeds or make you feel hoarse. If you have any problems tell your doctor. Most people do not have any other side effects to Suprefact. However, if you notice any of the following symptoms tell your doctor and ask if you should continue using the nasal spray:     Headaches, palpitations, feeling tired, nervous, drowsy, depressed, anxious or emotional, have disturbed sleep or lapses in memory or concentration.

The tablets also contain the following ingredients: anhydrous colloidal silica, maize starch, povidone, microcrystalline cellulose and magnesium stearate. The UK product licence for Mifegyne is held by Roussel Laboratories Limited, Uxbridge, UB9 5HP. The product is manufactured in France by Roussel Uclaf, Compiègne.   Mifegyne acts by blocking the effects of progesterone a hormone which is needed for pregnancy to continue. Mifegyne also softens and dilates the opening to the womb. Mifegyne is used prior to surgical termination of pregnancy.    THE TREATMENT   The treatment will consist of three Mifegyne tablets which will be taken in the presence of your doctor. This will be followed within 2 days by a surgical procedure which will terminate the pregnancy. Your doctor will explain this to you.     WILL THE TREATMENT SUIT YOU?   Most women can have the treatment. However some women should not. You should not have the treatment if:     you are not definitely pregnant     you have an ectopic pregnancy (where the egg has implanted in your tubes rather than in your womb)     In some other circumstances the treatment may also be unsuitable so please tell the doctor if: - you have a heart complaint or are receiving treatment for high blood pressure     if you suffer badly from asthma, bronchitis or have diabetes     you suffer from any condition or illness or are taking medicines of any kind     you know you have high blood cholesterol levels     you have ever had a bad reaction or are allergic to mifepristone     The doctor will then be able to discuss with you if you are able to have the treatment.   If you are breast feeding, you should stop for at least 14 days. Your doctor will be able to advise you when breast feeding can be restarted.     WHAT ABOUT OTHER MEDICINES?   Some medicines may interfere with the treatment and should not be used until it is over. These include some pain relief tablets such as aspirin, ibuprofen and mefenamic acid which should not be taken after you have had the Mifegyne tablets and until after the surgical procedure. If you need to take other medicines, please tell your doctor.     HOW WILL I TAKE THE TREATMENT?     you will be given 3 tablets of Mifegyne to swallow with some water which you must take at the hospital or clinic.     you will be able to go home 2 hours after taking the tablets once the doctor is sure you will not be sick.     you must then return to the hospital within 2 days for a surgical procedure which your doctor will explain to you. You will be told when to return to the hospital and given an appointment time. Obviously, if there is any cause for concern you can either contact the hospital or return to the hospital prior to the appointment time.      MF29      WHAT IF I CHANGE MY MIND ABOUT THE TERMINATION?   Once you have taken the Mifegyne tablets you should be aware that changing your mind would be inadvisable as there is a risk that if the pregnancy continues the baby may be born with abnormalities. This should be discussed with your doctor.   In the unlikely event of the treatment failing, you should consult your doctor at your follow-up visit about the need to terminate the pregnancy by another method.     WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF TREATMENT?     after taking the Mifegyne tablets nothing much will happen for about 12 hours. You may feel unwell, perhaps a little faint or sick during the first few hours. You may suffer from a headache or have a skin rash.     after 12 hours you may start to bleed, the chances of this happening will depend on how advanced your pregnancy is. About a half of the women who have taken the treatment started to bleed in the two days before coming back to hospital. The bleeding may be quite heavy, like a heavy period, you may also get cramps like period pains.     a small number of women may also develop some infection. The doctor needs to check if this has happened and give antibiotic treatment if needed.     If you have a lot of pain the doctor will be able to give you some pain killers such as paracetamol or codeine. Pain can be worse in women who have never been pregnant before or who normally suffer from painful periods.   If you think you are reacting badly in any of these or any other ways to your medicine, talk to your nurse or doctor straight away.    HOW SHOULD I STORE MY MEDICINE?    You will not be asked to store your medicine. It will be brought to you to be taken straight away.   Mifegyne tablets must be stored below 30°C (normal room temperature).   Do not take the tablets if they are past the expiry date on the box.     DATE OF REVISION July 1995PL 0109/0232    WHAT ELSE SHOULD I KNOW?      What about contraception?   It is possible for you to become pregnant again immediately after the termination is complete so you will need to start contraception within three to nine days of taking the Mifegyne tablets. Ask your doctor what you need.   THIS FORM MUST NOT BE COPIED OR CIRCULATED.   ©  This leaflet is the copyright of Hoechst Marion Roussel. Any unauthorised reproduction is prohibited  .

Trade marks of The Wellcome Foundation Limited 2/575495.01     More about shingles   You can only get shingles if you have already had chickenpox. This is because shingles is caused by the chickenpox virus becoming active again. The virus multiplies in the nerves and the skin. This causes the painful, blistering rash of shingles, usually in a band across one side of your body or face. Early treatment with an antiviral like Valtrex stops the virus multiplying so if you start your treatment straight away the tablets should help you to get better quicker.     What can I expect?   Your rash may be very painful at first, and you may still get new blisters appearing for about 5 days, then they will start to dry and form scabs. The rash may itch as it heals.   You may also feel very tired for a few weeks. For some time after the rash has disappeared, some people may still feel pain in that part of the body. As well as pain, some people may get ""abnormal sensations"" such as prickling and numbness where the rash was. These effects are caused by the shingles virus affecting the nerve during the early stage of the illness.     What else can I do?   Keeping the skin cool by using cool water compresses or calamine lotion can help the stinging and itching. Try to avoid scratching the rash, as this can stop it healing or could infect it with bacteria. Common painkillers such as aspirin or paracetamol can help with the pain. Make sure you eat well and drink plenty of fluids.   If you have any trouble with your eyes while you have shingles, see your doctor straight away, as you may need special treatments.     Who can catch shingles?   People of all ages get shingles, but it is more common in older people. Shingles can be passed on as chickenpox to other people if they have not already had chickenpox. For this reason, before the blisters have scabbed over, you should especially avoid close contact with:     babies and young children who haven't had chickenpox.     pregnant woman who haven’t had chickenpox.     people with weak immune systems, for example people taking steroids or who are being treated for cancer/HIV. This is because chickenpox can be a very serious disease for these people.        ",

"     This leaflet tells you about oral contraceptives in general and about Triadene in detail. Please read it carefully to get the best from Triadene. If you are in any doubt about these instructions contact your doctor, pharmacist or Family Planning clinic.    You and the pill How your body gets ready for pregnancy (the menstrual cycle)   You can usually become pregnant (conceive) from when you start to have periods, up until you are in your late 40s. Every menstrual cycle takes about 28 days. About halfway through this cycle an egg is released from one of your ovaries into a fallopian tube. This is called ovulation.   The egg travels down the fallopian tube towards your womb. When you make love, your partner's penis releases millions of sperm into your vagina. Some of these sperm travel up through your womb into your fallopian tubes. If there is an egg in one of these tubes, and a sperm reaches it, you can become pregnant. This is called 'conception'.   A fertilised egg gets embedded in the lining of your womb and takes 9 months to grow into a baby. As an egg can live for up to 2 days, and sperm for up to 5 days, you can become pregnant if you have made love up to 5 days before ovulation and for some time afterwards. If a sperm does not fertilise an egg, the egg is lost at the end of the menstrual cycle with the lining of your womb. This is called a 'period'.    How do natural hormones work?   Your menstrual cycle is controlled by two sex hormones made by your ovaries: one called oestrogen, the other progesterone (a progestogen). Oestrogen increases during the first half of your menstrual cycle, and makes your womb develop a thick lining, ready to receive the egg if conception happens. Progesterone comes later in the cycle and changes the lining of the womb still further to prepare it for pregnancy.   If you do not become pregnant, you make less of these hormones and this causes the lining of your womb to break down and the lining leaves your body as a period. But during pregnancy, your ovaries, and then the placenta (this attaches the growing baby to the womb and gives it food), carry on making progesterone and oestrogen to stop any more eggs being released.     How does the pill work?   A pill such as Triadene contains hormones which are like those your body produces (oestrogen and progestogen). These help stop you from getting pregnant, just as your natural hormones would stop you conceiving again when you are already pregnant.   The combined contraceptive pill protects you against getting pregnant in 3 ways:     No egg is released to be fertilised by sperm.     The fluid in the neck of your womb thickens so it is more difficult for sperm to enter it.     The lining of your womb does not thicken enough for an egg to grow in it.       How effective is the pill?   The pill is one of the most effective contraceptives apart from sterilisation. But this can only be true when it is taken correctly.

What you should know before taking Triadene   Before you start taking Triadene your pelvic organs, breasts and blood pressure should be checked by your doctor and these checks should be repeated regularly. The doctor will also make sure you are not pregnant.   If anyone in your family has had any illness caused by blood clots, or a heart attack, or a stroke at a young age, tell your doctor.   The following conditions need watching carefully while you are taking the pill:   If you have:     severe depressive states, past or present.     varicose veins.     diabetes (diabetes mellitus) or a tendency towards diabetes.     high blood pressure (hypertension).     fits (epilepsy).     the inherited form of deafness known as otosclerosis.     the disease of the nervous system called multiple sclerosis.     the inherited disease called porphyria.       calcium deficiency with cramps (tetany).     the movement disorder called Sydenham's chorea.     breast problems, past or present.     diseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular diseases).     kidney diseases.     disturbed liver function.     you are very overweight (obese).     an intolerance of contact lenses.     systemic lupus erythematosus-SLE (inflammation of connective tissue).     asthma.     uterine fibroids (benign tumour of the womb).     gallstones.     migraine.     brown patches on the face and body (chloasma).

If any of these conditions gets worse or you have them for the first time, this may be a sign that you should stop taking Triadene.   When you stop taking Triadene it may take some time for your regular periods to return.    Taking other medicines with Triadene   Some medicines may stop Triadene from working properly,   If you are taking any other medicine while you are taking Triadene, be sure to tell your doctor (or dentist). Your doctor (or dentist) can tell you whether you should use extra contraceptive precautions and for how long.   Medicines which can sometimes stop Triadene from working properly are antibiotics (such as ampicillin and rifampicin); griseofulvin (which is used to treat fungal infections); phenylbutazone (which is used as an anti-inflammatory drug to treat some types of joint diseases), phenytoin primidone, phenobarbitone and some other medicines used in people with epilepsy, and carbamazepine (which can be used to treat epilepsy or other illnesses).   If you are taking any of these medicines you might still be able to use Triadene, but you will also need to use an extra contraceptive method (condoms or cap plus spermicide) while you are taking the other medicine and for 7 days after you stop taking it. If your present pack ends before these 7 days, start the next pack the next day without a break. This means taking a pill every day during your normal 7 pill-free days.   If you run two packs together you may not have a period until the end of two packs, but this is not harmful. If you do not have a period after the second pack, you must talk to your doctor before you start the next pack.   If you are taking rifampicin you will need to use another method of contraception as well as Triadene. You should do this while you are taking the rifampicin and for 4 weeks after you stop.   If you are diabetic your doctor may alter the dose of medicine required to treat your diabetes.   If you are in doubt check with your doctor, pharmacist or Family Planning clinic.    Stomach upsets   Being sick or having very bad diarrhoea may stop Triadene from working properly and make it less effective. Carry on taking Triadene as usual, and also use another method of contraception, (condom or cap plus spermicide) until 7 days after you have recovered from the stomach upset. If you finish your pack before these 7 days, start the next pack the next day without a break. This means taking a pill every day during your normal 7 pill-free days. If you run two packs together you may not have a period until the end oftwo packs, but this is not harmful. If you do not have a period after the second pack, you must talk to your doctor before starting the next pack. If your stomach upset continues for some time, consult your doctor who may consider another form of contraception.    Warnings   It has been suggested, on the basis of statistical evidence, that the risk of developing various disorders of the circulation of the blood is slightly greater in women who take the combined pill than in those who do not. This can lead to, for example, deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in the leg), strokes (blood clots and haemorrhages from the blood vessels of the brain), heart attacks or pulmonary embolism (blood clots blocking the arteries of the lungs). People do not always fully recover from these disorders, and, very rarely, they are fatal. Studies suggest that these disorders occur less often with modern low-dose oral contraceptives then with older pills.   Certain conditions increase the risk of thrombosis.   They include:     smoking.     obesity.     some diseases of the heart and blood vessels.     diabetes.     migraine.     a major operation or period of immobilisation (e.g.     you are in bed after an accident or operation or you     have a plaster cast on a broken leg).     if any members of your family have suffered from thromboembolic diseases (e.g. deep vein thrombosis, stroke or heart attack) at a young age.     varicose veins.     If any of these conditions apply to you before you decide to take Triadene or while you are taking Triadene you must discuss them with your doctor.   The risk of arterial thrombosis (e.g. heart attack and stroke) associated with the pill increases with age, and this risk is increased by cigarette smoking. For this reason, the use of combined pills by women in the older age-group, especially those who also smoke, is discouraged.   Signs and symptoms of blood clots are given in the section ""Reasons for stopping Triadene immediately""   The pill does give a substantial degree of protection against cancers of the ovary and the lining of the womb. An increased risk of cervical cancer in long-term users of the pill has been reported in some; studies. It is uncertain whether this increased risk is caused by the pill as it could be due to the effects of sexual behaviour and other factors.   The evidence linking use of the pill and breast cancer is unclear. Some studies suggest an increased risk of breast cancer in women below the age of 35, the risk increasing the longer the pill is used. Any possible increased risk of breast cancer with combined pills is, however, likely to be small.   The combination of ethinyloestradiol and gestodene, like other contraceptives, has been linked with an increased incidence of abnormal growths in the rat liver, but it is unclear whether this could happen in humans. On rare occasions, the use of the pill has led to liver diseases such as jaundice and benign liver tumours, and, very rarely, it has been associated with some forms of malignant liver tumours (cancer) in long-term users. Liver tumours may lead to life-threatening intra-abdominal haemorrhage (bleeding in the abdomen). Therefore, if you have pain in the upper abdomen that does not soon clear up, tell your doctor. Also, if your skin becomes yellow (jaundice) you must tell your doctor.   If you think you might be pregnant, stop taking Triadene and consult your doctor immediately. Use another method of contraception such as a condom until you see your doctor.   Certain conditions may sometimes get worse during use of the pill. The diseases are those listed under ""What you should know before taking Triadene"".      Reasons for stopping Triadene immediately   If you experience any of the following conditions take no further tablets of Triadene and consult your doctor immediately. In the meantime use another method of contraception such as a condom.     migraine for the first time, or if existing migraine occurs more often than before.     unusually bad headaches or if you have headaches more often than before.     sudden changes to your eyesight, hearing, speech, sense of smell, taste or touch.     Unusual pains in your leg or unusual swelling of your arms or legs, sharp pains in your chest or sudden shortness of breath, crushing pains or feelings of heaviness in your chest coughing for no apparent reason, dizziness or fainting or if one side of your body suddenly becomes very weak or numb. These may be symptoms of blood clot formation or symptoms of an inflammation of veins combined with the formation of blood clots(thrombophlebitis).     your skin becomes yellow (jaundice), you develop hepatitis (inflammation of the liver) or if your whole body starts itching.     an increase in the number of fits (epileptic seizures).     a large increase in your blood pressure.     severe depression.     severe upper abdominal pains or unusual swelling of your abdomen.     definite worsening of conditions which had got worse during a previous pregnancy or while taking the pill in the past.     pregnancy.     surgery or immobilisation. You must stop Triadene six weeks before a planned major operation (e.g. stomach surgery), if you are having any surgery to the legs, or medical treatment for varicose veins. Also if you are immobilised for a long time (e.g. you are in bed after an accident or operation or you have a plaster cast on a broken leg). Your doctor will advise you when to start taking Triadene again.      How to take Triadene   This pack is designed to help you remember to take your pills.      When to start   If you are new to the pill or are starting the pill again after a break, take your first Triadene tablet on the first day of bleeding of your next period. For other users, follow instructions for ""Changing from another type of oral contraceptive"", ""Starting Triadene after having a baby"" or ""Starting Triadene after a miscarriage or an abortion"".     Taking your first pack of Triadene   In addition to the pills, the Triadene box contains 3 self-adhesive stickers marked with the days of the week.   Peel off one of the stickers and place it onto the pill pack so that the first day of pill taking is directly under the red section marked ""start"".   For instance, if you start the pills on a Monday, the ""start"" section should be lined up with a day marked ""Mon"".   You can now see on which day you have to take each pill.   After taking your first pill which is marked ""start"" take one pill each day, following the direction of the arrows, until you have finished all 21 pills in the pack.   You should try to take the pill at the same time every day, for example, after breakfast.   Swallow each pill whole, with water if necessary.    By starting in this way you will have contraceptive protection at once.Your seven pill-free days   After you have taken all 21 tablets, you have 7 days when you take no tablets. A few days after you have taken the last pill from each pack you will have a period. Your periods will be regular, probably lighter than before and almost always painless. The feelings that often make the last days before a period unpleasant (called premenstrual syndrome) usually disappear. You will not have to take extra contraceptive precautions during the 7 day break from taking the pill as long as you have taken your pills correctly and start the next pack on time.      Taking your next pack of Triadene   Start taking your next pack of Triadene after 7 pill-free days. Each new pack will begin on the same day of the week as the one before, so it is easy to remember when to start again. You should start taking your next pack of Triadene after 7 days, even if you are still bleeding. The table ""How to take Triadene"" should help you to take the pills properly.     Changing from another type of oral contraceptive 21 day combined pill   If you are taking a 21 day contraceptive pill, finish that pack and then start taking Triadene the next day. Do not leave a gap between packs. Start with a pill from a blister which you have marked with the correct day of the week. Then follow the instructions as described before. (see ""Taking your first pack of Triadene""). By starting in this way you will have contraceptive protection at once. You may not have a period until the end of the first Triadene pack but this is not harmful. You may have some bleeding on pill-taking days, but do not worry.    Every Day (ED) combined pill (28 day pill)   Triadene should be started after taking the last active tablet from the Every Day pill pack. If you are not sure which tablets are the active ones, ask your doctor or pharmacist. The first Triadene tablet is taken the next day which means that you do not leave a gap between packs. Start with a pill from a blister which you have marked with the correct day of the week. Return to your pharmacist any remaining inactive tablets from your old Every Day pack. Then follow the instructions as before (see ""Taking your first pack of Triadene""). By starting in this way you will have contraceptive protection at once. You may not have a period until the end of the first Triadene pack, but this is not harmful. You may have some bleeding on pill-taking days, but do not worry.     Mini pill (progestogen-only pill)   The first Triadene tablet should be taken on the first day of the period, even if you have already taken a mini pill on that day. Return to your pharmacist any mini pills left in your old pack. Start with a pill from a blister which you have marked with the correct day of the week. Follow the instructions as before (see ""Taking your first pack of Triadene""). By starting in this way you will have contraceptive protection at once.      Starting Triadene after having a baby   If you have just had a baby, your doctor may advise you to start taking Triadene 21 days after delivery provided that you are fully mobile. You do not have to wait for a period. You will need to use another method of contraception, such as a condom, until you start Triadene and for the first 7 days of pill-taking. Follow the instructions as before (see ""Taking your first pack of Triadene"").   The use of Triadene during breast feeding may reduce the amount of milk that you produce.   Very small amounts of the active ingredients of Triadene are found in breast milk. If you are breast feeding and want to take Triadene you should discuss this with your doctor. Your doctor may decide to give you the mini pill instead.    Starting Triadene after a miscarriage or an abortion   If you have just had a miscarriage or an abortion your doctor may advise you to start using Triadene   immediately. Follow the instructions as before (see ""Taking your first pack of Triadene"").     While you are taking Triadene What to do if you miss a period   Occasionally, you may miss a period. While this can mean you are pregnant, it is most unlikely if you have taken your pills correctly. Take your next pack as normal. If you think that you might have put yourself at risk (e.g. missed pills, taking other medicines} or if you miss a second period, see your doctor at once.     What to do if you forget to take a pill   If you forget to take a pill please follow these instructions:    If you are more than 12 hours late in taking a pill, or have missed more than one pill   Contraceptive protection may be lower, so you must use extra protection. Follow the instructions for the 7-day rule.      7-day rule     take the most recent 'late' pill and continue to take your next pills at your normal times   and      use an extra contraceptive method (condoms or cap plus spermicide) for the next 7 days   and      if your present pack ends before the 7 days do, start the next pack the next day, without a break. Do not leave a gap between packs. You will not have a period until you have finished the next pack, but this is not harmful. You may see some bleeding on pill-taking days, but do not worry. If you do not have a period after the second pack, you must talk to you r doctor before you start the next pack.      If one pill is 12 hours late or less   Don't worry. Contraceptive protection should not be affected if you take the late pill at once, and keep taking your next pills at the usual time. This may mean taking two pills in one day.      What should you do if you lose a pill?   If you lose a pill, the easiest thing to do is to take the last pill of the pack in place of the lost pill. Then take all the other pills on their proper days. Your cycle will one day shorter than normal, but contraceptive protection is not affected. After your 7 pill-free days you will have a new starting-day, one day earlier than before. Should you lose a pack of pills halfway through, ask your doctor or pharmacist what to do.     What if you have bleeding between periods?   A small number of women may have a little breakthrough bleeding or spotting while taking Triadene especially during the first few months. Normally, this bleeding is nothing to worry about, and will stop in a day or two. Keep taking the pills as usual, and the problem should disappear after the first few packs.   If the bleeding keeps on returning, is annoying or long-lasting, talk to your doctor. Also, if you start to have breakthrough bleeding for the first time after being on Triadene for a long time, you should see your doctor.   Unexpected bleeding may also be a sign of irregular pill-taking, so try to take your pill at the same time every day.     Will you put on weight?   Unless you usually have trouble keeping your weight down this is unlikely. But you may find you have a bigger appetite while you are taking the pill, so it is wise to watch what you eat.      What if you want to have a baby?   The bleeding you have after each pack (including the last pack) is not a true period. Your doctor relies on the date of your last true period before you get pregnant to tell you when your baby will be born. So, if you stop taking Triadene to have a baby, use another method of contraception until you have had a true period. However, it will not be harmful if you become pregnant straight away.     Are there any extra benefits of the pill?   Your periods may become shorter, more regular and less painful. Heavy periods may become lighter. The symptoms that often make the last few days before a period so unpleasant (known as premenstrual syndrome) usually disappear. Long-term use of the pill reduces your risk of cancers of the ovaries and of the lining of the womb.     Overdosage   Overdosage may cause nausea, vomiting and, in females, withdrawal bleeding. You should consult your doctor who will be able to advise you what action, If any, ~s necessary.     Possible side-effects   Sometimes unwanted effects occur with Triadene. These can be mild or serious.     Mild reactions   Sometimes mild unwanted effects can occur in the first few months after starting Triadene.     bleeding and spotting between your periods can     sometimes occur for the first few months but this usually stops once your body has adjusted to Triadene. If it continues, becomes heavy or starts again, contact your doctor.     headaches.     feeling sick, being sick and stomach upsets.     sore breasts.     depressive moods, loss of interest in sex.     changes in weight.     chloasma (yellow brown patches on the skin). This     may happen even if you have been using Triadene for a number of months. Chloasma may be reduced by avoiding too much sunlight.     poor tolerance of contact lenses.       Serious reactions   More serious reactions have sometimes been associated with contraceptive pills that contain oestrogen and progestogen, for example thrombosis (the formation of a clot in blood vessels) or liver disease. These are explained more fully in the ""Warnings"" section.   If you think that you have a serious adverse reaction to Triadene, stop taking your tablets and consult your doctor as soon as possible.   If you think you have an unwanted effect due to Triadene even if it is not included in this leaflet, tell your doctor or a pharmacist about it.   Effect on blood tests: The use of oral contraceptives may affect the results of certain laboratory tests. Always tell your doctor or the laboratory staff that you are using an oral contraceptive.    Expiry date:   The expiry date is printed on the pack. Do not use after this date.    Storage:   Store all medicines out of the reach of children.

"      Blocadren (timolol maleate, MSD)   PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS LEAFLET CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU START TO TAKE YOUR TABLETS.   Keep this leaflet. You may want to read it again.    What is in your tablets?    Active ingredients   The active ingredient in your tablets is timolol maleate. Blocadren is available as blue, half-scored tablets containing 10 mg of timolol maleate EP.    Other ingredients   Microcrystalline cellulose, EP, pregelatinised maize starch BP, magnesium stearate EP, indigo carmine E 132. Blocadren Tablets are available in bottles of 100 tablets.      How do your tablets work?   The active ingredient in your tablets is timolol maleate. This belongs to a group of medicines known as beta-adrenergic-receptor blockers, or beta-blockers. These medicines work by blocking the effect of normal body chemicals, such as adrenaline, which may abnormally increase heart rate and activity and raise blood pressure. Timolol maleate reduces heart rate and activity, and lowers blood pressure. Beta-blockers are also useful in preventing migraine headaches.     Who makes your tablets?   Your tablets are made by Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited, Shotton Lane, Cramlington, Northumberland, for Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited, Hertford Road, Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, UK, who hold the Product Licence in the UK and the Product Authorisation in Ireland.     Why do you need to take these tablets?   Your doctor has probably prescribed Blocadren for you for one of the following reasons, which he will have explained to you:     your blood pressure is too high     you suffer from angina (pain in the chest due to an inadequate supply of blood to the heart)     you have had a heart attack which caused damage to the heart muscle; long-term treatment with beta-blockers may reduce the risk of further damage to the heart muscle and help prevent another heart attack.     you suffer from migraine; beta-blockers are used to help prevent migraine.       Are there patients who should not take these tablets?   Yes, do not take the tablets if:     you are or think you may be pregnant     you are planning to become pregnant     you are breast-feeding     you have had a bad reaction (including allergic reactions) to this or similar medicines, or to any of the ingredients in the past     you suffer from asthma/lung disease     your doctor has told you that you have a condition known as heart block, heart failure or enlarged heart, which may have the following symptoms: tiredness after light exercise, breathlessness, and swelling of your ankles and legs.

PERGONAL is a combination of hormones which is used to treat infertility caused by certain conditions in both men and women, which are as follows:     used to treat women who are not having periods or are not producing eggs     used along with other medicines for women undergoing multiple follicle development for assisted-conception techniques e g. in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment;     used to stimulate the production of sperm in men suffering from a condition called hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism which may make you infertile.      Your doctor can explain why PERGONAL has been given to you        Who should not be given PERGONAL?   Although PERGONAL can be used in most people with the conditions stated above, there are certain people who should not be given the medicine These people are listed below:     Women in which the treatment would not be expected to work e.g. women with blocked or damaged tubes (unless you are having IVF treatment).     Men or women suffering from other hormonal disorders which have not been treated.     Women who are pregnant or breast feeding.     Speak to your doctor if you think that you are one of the people who should not be given PERGONAL.    Important Information you should know about PERGONAL   PERGONAL may cause pain and soreness at the injection site; on occasions fever and joint pains occur   Some patients have had allergic type reactions (rash, itching, etc.) possibly due to the lactose which is in the medicine. Tell your doctor if you think you might be allergic to the medicine.   A condition called ovarian hyperstimulation can occur This is when the ovaries overreact to the treatment. Your doctor will carry out tests, such as ultrasound, to minimise the chance of this occurring. This condition can cause various symptoms to occur. The most common is abdominal (stomach) pain If this happens, speak to the nurse or doctor responsible for your treatment as soon as you can. If you are injecting PERGONAL yourself then   do not   give any more injections until you have spoken to the nurse or doctor. The doctor will then decide whether or not to continue the treatment cycle. If you have to stop treatment you will be asked not to have sexual intercourse, and usually you will just have to rest. Rarely, the condition can be severe and you may need to be in hospital.   Sometimes multiple pregnancies occur following treatment. The majority of these are twins. It is very rare to have a large number of babies at the same time due to treatment with PERGONAL   There have been reports of ectopic pregnancies (a pregnancy where the embryo has implanted outside the womb} in women undergoing assisted conception techniques (e g. IVF). This has not been shown to be due to treatment with PERGONAL .   Pregnancy loss (miscarriage) in women undergoing assisted conception techniques is higher than normal but much ! the same as the rates found in women with other fertility problems.     The risk of the baby having any abnormalities is not increased by taking PERGONAL.    This medicine should not be used by children or the elderly      How will PERGONAL be given to you?   PERGONAL is given by injection into the muscle.     Women   Different doses are given depending on your treatment.   (l)   Women who are not having periods or producing eggs   PERGONAL is given as a course of either daily injections or injections every other day. If you are receiving daily     injections you will probably start at a dosage of l or 2 ampoules. This may be increased or decreased at approximately one week intervals. If you are receiving alternative day injections you will probably receive 3-S ampoules of PERGONAL 3 times a week. Your doctor will be able to explain your treatment plan to you and will tell you when is the best time to have sexual intercourse. Your dosage may be changed during future cycles depending on how you respond to the treatment.      Women undergoing assisted conception techniques      PERGONAL will be used along with other medicines. You will probably be given 2-3 ampoules of PERGONAL a day. There are different dosage plans; your doctor can explain yours to you. Your treatment will be continued until the right response has occurred.   In both cases, your doctor will carry out tests throughout the treatment to check on how the treatment is going.   If an excessive response to the treatment occurs, it is possible that your doctor may stop your treatment during a cycle but your treatment may re-start at a different dose    Men   Your treatment may start by being given injections of another medicine twice a week. l ampoule of PERGONAL can then be added in three times a week. This treatment will carry on for at least four months. Your doctor may want to test your sperm during this time. Your doctor will be able to explain more about your treatment.     Can PERGONAL cause side-effects?   Any medicine can cause side-effects. The following side-effects have been seen occasionally:     Women   Pain and redness at the injection site, allergic reactions (itching, rash, etc.), fever and joint pain, multiple pregnancies, and ovarian hyperstimulation (as already described earlier in the leaflet) Men   No side-effects have been reported.

IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR ARE NOT SURE ABOUT SOMETHING IN THIS LEAFLET, ASK YOUR DOCTOR OR PHARMACIST (CHEMIST)       CANESTEN 10% VC (VAGINAL CREAM)   WHAT IS CANESTEN 10% VC?   It is a white   vaginal   cream containing 10% of the active ingredient clotrimazole.   The other ingredients are benzyl alcohol, polysorbate, sorbitan monostearate, cetyl stearyl alcohol, isopropyl myristate, cetyl esters wax and water.   The single-dose 5g pack is a full course of treatment.   Canesten 10% VC contains clotrimazole.  This is one of a group of medicines called imidazoles which are used to treat fungal infections such as thrush.   Product Licence holder:   Bayer plc, Pharmaceutical Division, Bayer House, Strawberry Hill Newbury, Berkshire RG14 1JA Manufacturer: Bayer AG Leverkusen, Germany   WHEN SHOULD I USE CANESTEN 10% VC?   Canesten 10% VC should be used to treat vaginal thrush.    Vaginal thrush (candidiasis) is a common infection caused by a fungus which may live harmlessly in the vagina without you even noticing it.  However, in certain circumstances it may develop into an infection in the vagina and the symptoms may spread to the surrounding area (the vulva).   The common symptoms of thrush are:     itching of the vagina and vulva     redness and swelling of the tissues of the vagina and vulva     soreness of the vagina     a white non-smelling discharge from the vagina     Not everybody who has thrush has all these symptoms.  You may have only one of them.    If this is the first time you have had these symptoms, talk to your doctor before using any treatment.    WHEN SHOULD I NOT USE CANESTEN 10% VC?   Do not use Canesten 10% VC if you have previously had an allergic reaction to the active ingredient clotrimazole.  If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor.   See your doctor as soon as possible and   do not   use Canesten 10% VC if you have any of the following symptoms:     irregular vaginal bleeding     abnormal vaginal bleeding or a blood-stained discharge     ulcers, blisters or sores of the vagina or vulva     lower abdominal pain     pain or difficulty in passing urine     fever or chills     feeling sick or vomiting     diarrhoea     a foul smelling discharge from the vagina     This is because Canesten 10% VC may not be the right treatment for you.    If you are unsure whether you have thrush, check with your doctor before using Canesten 10% VC.    WHAT SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS SHOULD I TAKE?   If you are pregnant or are planning a family, tell your doctor or pharmacist before using Canesten  10% VC.  If you have informed your doctor or pharmacist already, follow their instructions carefully.   During pregnancy, extra care should be taken when using the applicator.   Before using Canesten 10% VC, you should see your doctor if:     you have had more than two infections in the last six months     you or your partner have ever had a sexually transmitted disease     you are aged under 16 or over 60 years     you have ever had an allergic reaction to Canesten or any other anti-fungal products     WHEN AND HOW DO I USE CANESTEN 10% VC?   The carton contains a pre-filled applicator of   vaginal   cream wrapped in foil.   You should insert the pre-filled applicator of vaginal cream into the vagina at night before going to sleep. Warning: do not exceed the stated dose.    Please follow the instructions below carefully         Remove the applicator from the foil packaging.   Insert the plunger ""A"" into the applicator ""B"" (Diagram 1).     Unscrew the red cap ""C"" (Diagram 2).    Carefully put the applicator as deeply as is comfortable into the vagina (this is easiest when lying on your back with your knees bent up) (Diagram 3).    Holding the applicator in place, slowly press the plunger until it stops so that the measured dose of cream is deposited into the   vagina   (Diagram 4). Remove the applicator.   Dispose of the applicator in a safe place, out of the reach of children.     You can help prevent further infections if you follow these simple self-help tips:     Try to avoid wearing tight nylon knickers and close fitting jeans too often.  These provide warm and airless conditions which help the thrush fungus to grow.     Wash daily, but use simple, unperfumed soaps – not heavily scented or medicated ones.  Do not scrub hard with sponges or flannels, and avoid hot baths with strong perfumed oils or disinfectants.  The most soothing bath to have if you have thrush is a warm one with some salt in it.     After going to the toilet, do get into the habit of wiping yourself from front to back, as a thrush infection may easily be transferred from the bowel.     If you are still worried or have any further questions about the symptoms or the treatment, do not hesitate to ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice.   Canesten 10% VC should be used in the   vagina   only.  Do not put it in your mouth or swallow it.  If you do accidentally swallow it, tell your doctor straight away or contact the Accident and Emergency Department of your nearest hospital.     WHAT SIDE-EFFECTS MAY I   EXPERIENCE?   The symptoms of thrush such as burning, soreness or itching of the vagina and surrounding area should disappear  within three days of treatment. If no improvement is seen after seven days, tell your doctor.   Rarely, Canesten 10% VC may cause side-effects In some people. The side-effects are very similar to the symptoms of thrush.  If the redness, burning, irritation or swelling get worse, stop using the pessaries and see your doctor as soon as possible.   As with all medicines, some people may be allergic to  Canesten 10% VC.  Usually, if you are allergic to the vaginal cream, a reaction will occur soon after you start using it.  An allergic reaction may appear as a rash, nausea,  faintness or facial swelling.  If you experience any of these effects, tell your doctor Immediately.   If you feel you are reacting badly to this medicine in any other way, speak to your doctor or pharmacist.   HOW SHOULD I STORE MY CANESTEN 10% VC?   Keep Canesten 10% VC in a cool place (below 25ºC) but not in the refrigerator.  It is best to keep Canesten 10% VC in the original carton.

"    Canesten Combi          PLEASE READ THIS LEAFLET CAREFULLY BEFORE USING CANESTEN COMBI       Canesten Combi contains a Canesten 1 Pessary to treat the cause of thrush (vaginal candidiasis) and a tube of Canesten 1% cream to soothe and relieve the itching which is caused by thrush.  This leaflet contains information on how to use these products.  Please read it before using your Canesten Combi.    CANESTEN 1 PESSARY CANESTEN 1% CREAM    What do Canesten 1 Pessary and Canesten 1% Cream contain?   The pessary contains 500 mg of the active ingredient Clotrimazole BP.  The other ingredients are lactose microcrystalline cellulose, lactic acid, maize starch povidone, calcium lactate, magnesium stearate, silicon dioxide and poly (o-hydroxypropyl-o-methyl) cellulose.

The pack contains one 500 mg pessary with an applicator and 20 g of 1% cream.   The Canesten 1 pessary and 1% cream are also available separately.  The pessary comes in a single dose pack and the cream comes in tubes of 20 g and 50g.   Canesten 1 Pessaries and 1% cream contain clotrimazole.  This is one of a group of medicines called imidazoles which are used to treat fungal infections such as thrush.   Product licence holder: Bayer plc, Pharmaceutical Division, Bayer House, Strawberry Hill, Newbury, Berkshire RG14 1JA.   Manufacturer: Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany.     When should I use the Canesten 1 Pessary?   The pessary should be used to   treat   vaginal thrush.   Vaginal thrush (candidiasis) is a common infection caused by a fungus which may live harmlessly in the vagina without you even noticing it.  However, in certain circumstances it may develop into an infection in the vagina and the symptoms may spread to the surrounding area (the vulva).    The common symptoms of thrush are:     itching of the vagina and vulva     redness and swelling of the tissues of the vagina and     vulva     soreness of the vagina     a white non-smelling discharge from the vagina     Not everybody who has thrush has all of these symptoms.    If this is the first time you have had these symptoms, talk to your doctor before using any treatment.      When should l use Canesten 1% Cream?   The cream should be used to soothe and relieve the irritation of the vulva (vulvitis) which is caused by thrush.   It can also be used for the treatment of irritation of the end of the penis (glans) which is caused by thrush.  If the cream is used to treat your sexual partner at the same time as your own treatment, it can help prevent re-infection and so reduce the frequency of your attacks of thrush.   Canesten 1% cream can also be used to treat fungal skin infections such as ringworm, athlete's foot, fungal nappy rash and fungal infection of the breast fold (intertrigo).     When should I not use Canesten 1 Pessary and Canesten 1% Cream?   Do not use the pessary or cream if you have previously had an allergic reaction to the active ingredient clotrimazole. If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor or pharmacist.   See your doctor as soon as possible and do not use the pessary if you have any of the following symptoms:     irregular vaginal bleeding     abnormal vaginal bleeding or a blood-stained discharge     ulcers, blisters, sores or pain of the vagina or vulva     lower abdominal pain     pain or difficulty in passing urine     fever or chills     feeling sick or vomiting     diarrhoea     a foul smelling discharge from the vagina       This is because the Canesten 1 Pessary may not be the right treatment for you.    If you are unsure whether you have thrush, check with your doctor before using Canesten Combi.      What special precautions should I take?   If you are pregnant or are planning a family, tell your doctor or pharmacist before using Canesten Combi.  If you have informed your doctor or pharmacist already, follow their instructions carefully.   During pregnancy, extra care should be taken when using the applicator.   Before using the pessary, you should see your doctor if:     you have had more than two infections in the last six months     you or your partner have ever had a sexually transmitted disease.     you are aged under 16 or over 60 years.     you have ever had an allergic reaction to Canesten or any other anti-fungal products.       When and how do I use Canesten Combi?   This carton contains one Canesten 1 Pessary held inside a foil blister pack, an applicator for insertion of the pessary into the vagina and a tube of Canesten 1% cream. This is a full course of treatment.   If Canesten Combi has been prescribed for you by your doctor, follow any instructions he/she may have given you.  If you have purchased this product without a prescription, follow these directions closely:     Canesten 1 Pessary   The applicator should be used to insert the pessary into the vagina before going to sleep at night.   Remove the applicator from the packaging.  Pull out plunger A until it stops.  Remove the pessary from the blister pack and place the pessary firmly into applicator B (Diagram 1).  To fit the pessary into the applicator, the holder of the applicator needs to be squeezed lightly at either side.  The pessary fits tightly into the applicator and needs to be squeezed into the holder just far enough to be held in place during insertion (about 1 cm).   Carefully put the applicator as deeply as is comfortable in the vagina (this is easiest when lying on your back with your knees bent up) (Diagram 2).     Holding the applicator in place, slowly press the plunger until it stops so that the pessary is deposited into the vagina (Diagram 3).    Remove the applicator.  Dispose of the applicator in a safe place, out of the reach of children.  The applicator cannot be flushed down the toilet.     Canesten 1% Cream   For the treatment of vulvitis, the cream should be thinly and evenly applied to the area around the entrance of the vagina, 2-3 times a day and rubbed in.           ",
"         A guide to using Fludara   This leaflet gives you some information about Fludara. Please talk to your doctor if you have any questions or worries about your treatment with Fludara either before you start or while you are being treated.    What is chronic Iymphocytic leukaemia?   Fludara is used to treat chronic Iymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) This is a cancer of the type of white blood cells called lymphocytes Too many lymphocytes are produced and they either don't work properly or are too young (immature) to carry out the normal disease fighting functions of white blood cells If there are too many of these abnormal cells they push aside (displace) healthy blood cells in the bone marrow where most new blood cells are formed and in the blood stream and organs as well Without enough healthy blood cells, infections, anaemia, bruising, excessive bleeding (haemorrhaging) or even organ failure can result     The name of your medicine is: Fludara (fludarabine phosphate)     What does Fludara contain?   Each vial of Fludara contains 50mg fludarabine phosphate (equivalent to 39.05mg fludarabine) in a powder for injection It also contains the inactive ingredients mannitol (E421) and sodium hydroxide Each pack of Fludara contains 5 x 50mg vials     How does Fludara works?   In order for both normal and leukaemia cells to grow and produce more cells like themselves the cells' genetic material (DNA) must be copied and reproduced Fludara works by interfering with the production of new DNA. Therefore, when Fludara is taken up by the  leukaemia cells it stops the growth of new leukaemia cells   Fludara is a cytotoxic (anti-cancer) drug.     Who is responsible for Fludara?     The product licence is held by:    Schering Health Care Ltd The Brow, Burgess Hill West Sussex RH1 5 9NE      Fludara is manufactured on behalf of Schering AG, Berlin, Germany by:    Ben Venue Laboratories Bedford. Ohio, USA    Uses   Fludara is used in the treatment of chronic Iymphocytic leukaemia This is a cancer of the white blood cells called lymphocytes Fludara is used in patients with chronic Iymphocytic leukaemia if the first treatment has not worked, or has stopped working Reasons for not using Fludara If you are pregnant or breast feeding, if you know you are allergic (hypersensitive) to any of the ingredients of this medicine or if your kidneys work at only a very low level you should not be given Fludara What you should know before you are given Fludara Fludara should not be used with another drug called pentostatin or deoxycoformycin The number of normal blood cells may also be reduced and you will have regular blood tests during treatment If you notice any unusual bruising, excessive bleeding after injury or if you seem to be catching a lot of infections tell your doctor. In extremely rare cases death has resulted  from the reduction in red blood cells.   If you have any form of kidney disease or if you are over 70 years old, your kidney function should be checked regularly If it is found that your kidneys do not work properly you may be given Fludara at a reduced dose. If your kidneys work at only a very low level you will not be given Fludara. If you are over 75 years old, Fludara will be given with caution .   If you have very severe chronic Iymphocytic leukaemia your body may not be able to get rid of all the waste products from the cells destroyed by Fludara This may cause dehydration, kidney failure and heart problems Your doctor will be aware of this and may give you other drugs to stop this happening   When used in patients with acute leukaemia at doses four times greater than the recommended dose for chronic Iymphocytic leukaemia a third of patients experienced severe central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) effects including blindness, coma and death Such effects have only very rarely been reported in patients having the recommended dose for chronic Iymphocytic leukaemia However, you should mention to your doctor any unusual symptoms you experience.   The effect on the central nervous system of long-term use of Fludara is unknown but some people have received the recommended dose for up to I 5 courses of therapy Men, and women who may still be fertile, must use a reliable form of contraception during, and for at least 6 months after stopping, treatment Check with your doctor about any    Other commonly reported symptoms      ",

In asthma and some allergic conditions, such as rhinitis (inflammation of the mucous membranes in the nose) and conjunctivitis (inflammation of the mucous membranes in the eye), certain substances are released in the body which trigger inflammatory responses (eg inflammation of the airways in asthma).

"      PLEASE READ BOTH SIDES OF THIS LEAFLET CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU START TO TAKE YOUR TABLETS    Keep this leaflet. You may want to read it again.     ZOCOR (simvastatin, MSD)    WHAT IS IN YOUR TABLETS?    Active ingredient   The active ingredient in 'Zocor' Tablets is simvastatin. 'Zocor' Tablets are available in three strengths. The peach-coloured tablets contain 10 mg simvastatin, the tan-coloured tablets contain 20 mg simvastatin and the brick-red coloured tablets contain 40 mg simvastatin.     Other ingredients   Ascorbic acid EP, butylated hydroxyanisole BP, citric acid, monohydrate EP, hydroxypropylcellulose EP, lactose EP, magnesium stearate EP, microcrystalline cellulose E460, pregelatinised maize starch BP, talc EP, red iron oxide E172, titanium oxide EP, yellow iron oxide E172, methylhydroxypropylcellulose EP.      HOW DO YOUR TABLETS WORK?   The active ingredient in your tablets is simvastatin. This belongs to a group of medicines known as 'HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors'. These work by reducing the amount of cholesterol your body makes. Cholesterol is vital to the normal functioning of the body, but if levels of cholesterol in the bloodstream are too high it can be deposited on the walls of the arteries. There it builds up to form plaques which can eventually block the blood vessel, just like scale furring-up a water pipe.   We only get a small amount of cholesterol from our diet; egg yolks and liver contain large amounts of cholesterol, but many foods like fruit, vegetables, and fish are quite low in cholesterol. Nearly all of the cholesterol in our bodies is made by our own livers.     WHO MAKES YOUR TABLETS?   Your tablets are made by Merck Manufacturing Division, Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited, Shotton Lane, Cramlington, Northumberland, for Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited, Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, UK, who holds the Product Licence in the UK.     WHY DO YOU NEED TO TAKE THESE TABLETS?   Your doctor has done some blood tests which show that, even though you may be taking a low-fat diet, you still have too much of one type of fat - called cholesterol - in your blood.   You have been prescribed 'Zocor' for the following reason, which your doctor will explain to you:     You have high cholesterol in your blood; 'Zocor' should lower this level. It is generally accepted that a high cholesterol level in your blood adds to the risk of heart disease. The higher the level, the greater the risk. The presence of other factors, such as existing heart disease, high blood pressure, high  blood sugar (diabetes), increased weight lack of exercise, and smoking, adds greatly to the risk of development or progression of heart disease with high cholesterol.     Your doctor may also have prescribed 'Zocor' because:     You have coronary heart disease (CHD). Cholesterol can cause CHD by clogging the blood vessels which carry oxygen and. nutrients to the heart. This clogging, or hardening of the arteries, is called atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis can lead to chest pain (called angina) and heart attack. If you have CHD, your doctor has prescribed 'Zocor' to help prolong your life, to lessen the risk of a heart attack, and to decrease the risk of needing a surgical procedure to increase the blood flow to your heart. 'Zocor' also slows the progression of atherosclerosis and may reduce the development of new atherosclerosis .     Your doctor will have explained the importance of staying on a low-fat diet as well as taking the tablets.     ARE THERE PATIENTS WHO SHOULD NOT     TAKE THESE TABLETS?   Yes; do not take the tablets if:     You are or think you may be pregnant.     You are planning to become pregnant.     You are breast-feeding.     You are a woman who could bear children unless you are taking a reliable form of contraceptive other than the pill. If you are planning to become pregnant you must stop taking 'Zocor' at least one month before trying to get pregnant.     You have liver problems.     You have a rare inherited disease called porphyria .     You have had a bad reaction to this or similar medicines or to any of the ingredients in the past.     If you think any of these apply to you, do not take the tablets, go and talk to your doctor first and follow the advice given.     WHAT ELSE SHOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT     TAKING YOUR TABLETS?   You should check with your doctor before taking 'Zocor' if:     You have persistent muscle aches or pains.     You are taking medicines called immunosuppressants, e.g. cyclosporin.     You are taking other cholesterol-lowering medicines such as fibric acid derivatives (such as bezafibrate, fenofibrate gemfibrozil).     You are taking an antifungal drug called itraconazole.     You are taking large doses (higher than 1 9 a day) of niacin or nicotinic acid.     'Zocor' contains lactose as an inactive ingredient and may produce symptoms in lactose-intolerant individuals.   Your doctor may want to do simple blood tests to check your liver is working properly before and during your treatment with 'Zocor'.    Rarely, a few patients have experienced the following: liver disease, muscle disease presenting as pains and aches, or an allergic reaction to 'Zocor'. The allergic reaction may include some of the following: swelling of the face or neck, muscle and joint pains, joint and      ",

Estraderm TTS 50 containing 4mg of oestradiol.  Your body will absorb about 50 micrograms of oestradiol each day whilst you are wearing an Estraderm TTS 50 patch.       Estraderm TTS 100 containing 8mg of oestradiol.  Your body will absorb about 100 micrograms of oestradiol each day whilst you are wearing an Estraderm TTS 100 patch.     Oestradiol is a form of oestrogen and belongs to a group of medicines known as Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) which are used to relieve symptoms of the menopause (change of life), such as hot flushes and night sweats.  Your  doctor may also prescribe this product (at a minimum dose of Estraderm TTS 50) for the prevention of osteoporosis (thinning of the bones).     Things to remember about Estraderm TTS     Make sure it is safe for you to use these patches (read the section inside this leaflet called 'Before using your patches').       Instructions for using these patches are given in this leaflet.  Please follow them carefully.     Estraderm TTS is NOT a contraceptive.  If you need advice about family planning talk to your doctor.     These patches may cause unwanted effects in some people. You can find information about them in this leaflet. (Look in the  section called 'After using your patches').     Keep your patches in a cool place, out of the reach of children.  When you take off a patch, fold it in half with the sticky side inwards and throw it away carefully.  Even used patches will contain some active medication so make sure that your patches are always kept well away from children.           Before using your patches     Are you being treated for a thrombosis (blood clot) of any kind?     Do you have any liver, kidney or heart disease?     Have you ever had treatment for a breast lump, or any serious disease of your womb?       Have you had any bleeding between periods or since your last period, if your periods have stopped?     Is there any chance that you may be pregnant?     If the answer to any of these questions is YES, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using your patches.      Have you ever suffered from hearing loss during pregnancy or when taking oestrogens, for example, oral contraceptives?     Do you suffer from epilepsy (fits) or migraine?     If the answer to either of these questions is YES, tell your doctor or pharmacist.   Most women using Estraderm will have had a hysterectomy (an   operation to remove the womb).  If you have not had a hysterectomy you will need to take another hormone called progestogen for 12 days each month.  You will probably have a 'period' each month towards the end of the course of progestogen. This is quite normal.    Using your patches     Always use your patches as directed by your doctor.      The patches should be changed twice each week, always on the same two days.  You may find it helpful to stick the 'day of the week' sticker beginning with your first day of treatment in the space on the inside cover of the carton.  This then shows the two days each week when you should change your patch.    Throw the other stickers away.    When you finish an Estraderm pack, start the next pack straightaway.  There is no need to have a break between packs.         Putting on a patch     Remove one sachet from the box and tear it open at the notch.  Use your fingers because cutting with scissors might damage the patch inside.  You must never cut or tear your patches in any way.         Take out the transparent patch and loosen the backing by rubbing the edge of the patch between your thumb and forefinger.  The stiff protective liner will peel off the flexible, sticky patch.         Stick the patch onto a hairless area of skin below the waist.  Most patients find that the buttock is the best place and that skin irritation is less likely to occur at this site.  You could also try the lower back, hip, abdomen or upper thigh.  Never put a patch on or near the breasts.      Choose a clean, dry area of skin.  Avoid skin which is red or irritated.  Never powder or oil your skin before putting on a patch as it may not stick properly.     Place the sticky patch on the area of skin you have chosen and press it firmly into position with the palm of your hand.  Pressing for 10 seconds or so will make it stick securely.      Run your finger around the edge of the patch to make sure that the edges stick.  Provided that you have applied the patch correctly, you can bathe, shower or swim with little risk of the patch coming off.     If the patch does come off in the bath or shower, just shake it to remove any water, dry the skin thoroughly and put it on again in the usual way.       When the time comes to change your patch, take off the old one, fold it in half with the sticky side inwards, and throw it away carefully out of the reach of children.  Remember, it will still contain some medication.      Always place your new patch on a fresh area of skin.      If you forget to change the patch at the right time, you should  change it as soon as possible. Then continue to change your patches on the usual days as normal.       After using your patches   These patches sometimes cause unwanted effects in some people:     Headaches, nausea or breast tenderness.       Cramping pains in the calf.     Feeling slightly bloated.     Slight redness and itching of the skin where a patch has been.  This usually disappears within 3-4 days of taking off the patch.     These effects are often mild and may wear off after a few weeks' treatment.   If they are very troublesome and do not improve tell your doctor.    Very rarely, a more severe skin reaction can occur.  If this happens, tell your doctor.   If you have not had a hysterectomy and you have any irregular bleeding or spotting after the first month or so of treatment, tell your doctor.       Other useful information     Sunbathing - always make sure your patch is covered by clothing.     Using a sunbed - either cover up your patch as above or take it off and put it back on after your shower when your skin is completely cool and dry.     Swimming - you can wear your  patch beneath your swimming costume during swimming.     Never stick on a patch straight after a hot bath or shower.  Wait a while for the skin to become completely cool and dry.     If a patch comes off and will not stick back on, apply a new patch in the usual way.  Remember to apply your next patch at the normal time. If you have run out of   patches, contact your doctor straightaway.       Precautions   Whilst you are receiving Estraderm TTS you should have regular check-ups with your doctor.  He or she will tell you how often this should he done.
