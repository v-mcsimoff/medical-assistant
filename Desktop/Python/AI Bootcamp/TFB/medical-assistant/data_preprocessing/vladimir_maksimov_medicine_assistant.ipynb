    "Este proyecto propone desarrollar un asistente basado en modelos de IA generativa que ayude a un paciente a entender de una manera más sencilla y directa la información relevante de un prospecto médico. La idea de negocio es tomar una foto de un prospecto médico y, mediante el uso de modelos de IA generativa, poder ofrecer un resumen, puntos importantes o la respuesta a una pregunta específica del usuario a partir de la información de la imagen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objetivos:\n",
    "- Desarrollo y justificación de la solución respecto a la parte de modelado.\n",
    "- Evaluación del modelo para analizar su impacto y posibles sesgos o alucinaciones.\n",
    "- Desarrollo de los componentes necesarios tanto para el desarrollo de los modelos como para la inferencia en producción.\n",
    "### Work Plan:\n",
    "1. Data preparation.\n",
    "- There will be several different datasets - one contains medicine leaflets, another consists of patients' questions and answers, and the third one contains images of written text.\n",
    "- The data should be pre-processed and cleaned.\n",
    "2. Model training. The idea is to train a model to process images and extract texts first, then summarize these texts following a detailed prompt to provide a patient with important information from the drug leaflets."
